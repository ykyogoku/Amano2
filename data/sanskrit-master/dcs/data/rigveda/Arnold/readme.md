# Lexical data from Arnold (1905), Vedic Metre

On pages 29-43, Arnold lists various linguistic criteria (including numerous words) he considers to be characteristic for old and late parts of the Rigveda. 
The three files in this directory contain the words, their ids in the DCS (field lexicon.id) and their meanings, separated with tabs.
The files '''arnold-vedic-metre-rigveda-words-1''' and '''arnold-vedic-metre-rigveda-words-2''' contain the old words, and '''arnold-vedic-metre-atharvaveda-forms''' those of the "popular" Rigveda, i.e. its late parts.

Note that there is no 1-to-1 match between Arnold's list and the data in the three files, because Arnold's list contains many compounds, which are often split into their components in the DCS.

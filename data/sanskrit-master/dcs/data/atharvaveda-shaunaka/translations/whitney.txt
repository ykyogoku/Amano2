1.1.4 Called on is the lord of speech; on us let the lord of speech call; may we be united with (''sam-gam'') what is heard; let me not be parted with what is heard.

1.2.1 We know the reed's father, Parjanya the much-nourishing; and we know well its mother, the earth of many aspects.
1.2.2 O bow-string, bend about us; make thyself a stone; being hard, put very far away niggards [and] haters.
1.2.3 When the kine, embracing the tree, sing the quivering dexterous (''ṝ ṛbhú'') reed, keep away from us, O Indra, the shaft, the missile.
1.2.4 As between both heaven and earth stands the bamboo (? ''téjana''), so let the reed-stalk (''múñja'') stand between both the disease and the flux (''āsrāvá'').
;;; 3 Against obstruction of urine: with a reed.

1.3.7 I split up thy urinator, like the weir of a tank - so be thy urine released, out of thee, with a splash! all of it.
1.3.8 Unfastened [be] thy bladder-orifice, like [that] of a water-holding sea - so be thy urine released, out of thee, with a splash! all of it.

;;; 7 To Agni: for the discovеrу of sorcerers.
1.7.1 Bring hither, O Agni, the sorcerer (''yātudhā́па''), the ''kimīdín'', speaking out (''stu''); for thou, O god, being revered, hast become slayer of the barbarian (''dásyu'').
1.7.2 O most exalted one (''parameṣṭhín''), Jātavedas, self-controller, Agni, partake of (''prа-аç'') the sacrificial butter, of the sesame oil (?); make the sorcerers cry out.
1.7.3 Let the sorcerers cry out (''ví-lap''), let the devouring ''kimīdíns;'' then do you, O Agni together with Indra, welcome this our oblation.
1.7.4 Let Agni first take hold; let Indra, having arms, push forth; let everyone that has a demon, coming, say "here am I."
1.7.5 We would fain see thy heroism (''vīryà''), O Jātavedas; proclaim to us the sorcerers, O men-watcher; let them all, burnt about by thee in front, come to this place, proclaiming themselves.
1.7.6 Take hold, O Jātavedas; thou wast born for our purpose; becoming our messenger, O Agni, make the sorcerers cry out.
1.7.7 Do thou, O Agni, bring hither the sorcerers bound; then let Indra with his thunderbolt crush in (''api-vraçc'') their heads.
;;; 8 To Agni and other gods: for the discovery of sorcerers.
1.8.1 This oblation shall bring the sorcerers, as a stream does the foam; whoever, woman [or] man, hath done this, here let that person speak out.
1.8.2 This man hath come, speaking out; this man do ye welcome; O Brihaspati, taking [him] into thy control - O Agni and Soma, do ye (two) pierce [him] through.

1.8.4 Wherever, O Agni, thou knowest the births of them, of the devourers that are in secret, O Jātavedas, them do thou, increasing through worship (''bráhman'') - slay of them, O Agni, with hundredfold transfixion.
;;; 9 For some one's advancement and success.
1.9.1 In this man let the Vasus maintain good things (vásu) - Indra, Pūshan, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni; him let the Ādityas and also the All-gods maintain in superior light.
1.9.2 At his direction (''pradiç''), O gods, be there light, sun, fire, or also gold; be his rivals (''sapátna'') inferior to him; to the highest firmament (''nā́ka'') make this man ascend.
1.9.3 With what highest worship (''bráhman''), O Jātavedas, thou didst bring together draughts (''páyas'') for Indra, therewith, O Agni, do thou increase this man here; set him in supremacy (''çrāíṣṭhya'') over his fellows (''sajātá'').

;;; 10 For some one's release from Varuṇa's wrath.
1.10.1 This Asura bears rule over the gods; for the wills (''váça'') of king Varuṇa [come] true; from him, prevailing by my worship (''bráhman''), from the fury of the formidable one (''ugrá'') do I lead up this man.
1.10.2 Homage be to thy fury, O king Varuṇa; for, O formidable one, thou dost note (''ni-ci'') every malice (''drugdhá''). A thousand others I impel (''pra-sū'') together; a hundred autumns of thee shall this man live.
1.10.3 In that thou hast spoken with the tongue untruth, much wrong - from the king of true ordinances (''-dhárman''), from Varuṇa, I release thee.
1.10.4 I release thee out of the universal, the great flood (''arṇavá''); speak, O formidable one, unto [thy] fellows here, and reverence our incantation (''bráhman'').
;;; 11 For successful childbirth.
1.11.1 At this birth, O Pūshan, let Aryaman [as] efficient (''vedhás'') invoker utter ''váṣaṭ'' for thee; let the woman, rightly engendered, be relaxed; let her joints go apart in order to birth.
1.11.2 Four [are] the directions of the sky, four also of the earth: the gods sent together the fœtus; let them unclose her in order to birth.
1.11.3 Let Pūshan (?) unclose [her or it]; we make the ''yóni'' go apart; do thou, ''sūṣaṇā'', loosen; do thou, ''biṣkalā'', let go.
1.11.4 Not as it were stuck (''ā́hata'') in the flesh, not in the fat, not as it were in the marrows, let the spotted slimy (?) afterbirth come down, for the dog to eat; let the afterbirth descend.
1.11.5 I split apart thy urinator, apart the ''yóni'', apart the [two] groins, apart both the mother and the child, apart the boy from the afterbirth; let the afterbirth descend.
1.11.6 As the wind, as the mind, as fly the birds, so do thou, O ten months' [child], fly along with the afterbirth; let the afterbirth descend.
;;; 12 Against various ailments (as results of lightning?).
1.12.1 First born of the afterbirth, the ruddy (''usríya'') bull, born of wind and cloud (?), goes thundering with rain; may he be merciful to our body, going straight on, breaking; he who, one force, hath stridden out threefold.
1.12.2 Thee, lurking (''çri'') in each limb with burning (''çocís''), we, paying homage, would worship (''vidh'') with oblation; we would worship with oblation the hooks, the grapples, [him] who, a seizer, hath seized this man's joints.
1.12.3 Release thou him from headache and from cough - whoever hath entered each joint of him; the blast (? ''çúṣma'') that is cloud-born and that is wind-born, let it attach itself to forest-trees (''vánaspáti'') and mountains.
1.12.4 Weal [be] to my upper member (''gā́tra''), weal be to my lower, weal to my four limbs; weal be to my body.

1.13.2 Homage to thee, child of the height (''pravát''), whence thou gatherest (''sam-ūh'') heat (''tápas''); be merciful to ourselves; do kindness (''máyas'') to our offspring (''toká'').
1.13.3 Child of the height, be homage to thee; homage we pay to thy missile (''hetí'') and heat (''tápus''); we know thy highest abode (''dhā́man'') that is in secret; thou art set as navel within the [cloud-]ocean.
1.13.4 Thou whom all the gods did create, the bold one, [the gods] making an arrow for hurling - do thou, besung in the council (''vidátha''), be merciful to us; to thee as such be homage, O goddess.
;;; 14 Imprecation of spinsterhood on a woman.
1.14.1 Her portion (''bhága''), splendor have I taken to myself, as from off a tree a garland; like a mountain with great base, let her sit long with the Fathers.

1.14.4 With the incantation (''bráman'') of Asita, of Kaçyapa, and of Gaya, I shut up (''api-nah'') thy portion (''vulva?''), as sisters do what is within a box (''-kóça'').
;;; 15 With an oblation: for confluence of wealth.
1.15.1 Together, together let the rivers flow, together the winds, together the birds (''patatrín''); this my sacrifice let them enjoy of old; I offer with a confluent (''saṁsrāvyà'') oblation.
1.15.2 Come straight hither to my call, hither ye confluents also; increase this man, ye songs; let every beast (''paçú'') there is come hither; let what wealth (''rayí'') there is stay (''sthā'') with him.
1.15.3 What fountains of the streams flow together, ever unexhausted, with all those confluences we make riches (''dhána'') flow together for me.
1.15.4 What [fountains] of butter (''sarpís'') flow together, and of milk, and of water, with all those confluences we make riches flow together for me.
;;; 16 Against demons: with an amulet of lead.
1.16.1 What devourers, on the night of new moon, have arisen troop-wise (?) - the fourth Agni is the demon-slayer; he shall bless us.
1.16.2 The lead Varuṇa blesses; the lead Agni favors; Indra bestowed on me the lead; it, surely, is a dispeller of familiar demons.
1.16.3 This overpowers the ''víṣkandha;'' this drives off (''bādh'') the devourers; with this I overpower all the races (''jātá'') that are the piçācī́'s.
1.16.4 If our cow thou slayest, if [our] horse, if [our] man (''púruṣa''), we pierce thee there with lead, that thou be no slayer of our heroes.
;;; 17 To stop the vessels of the body.
1.17.1 Yon women (''yoṣít'') that go, veins with red garments, like brotherless sisters (''jāmí'') - let them stop (''sthā''), with their splendor smitten.
1.17.2 Stop, lower one! stop, upper one! do thou too stop, midmost one! if the smallest stops, shall stop forsooth the great tube (''dhamáni'').
1.17.3 Of the hundred tubes, of the thousand veins, have stopped forsooth these midmost ones; the ends have rested (''ram'') together.
1.17.4 About you hath gone (''kram'') a great gravelly sandbank (''dhanū́''); stop [and] be quiet, I pray (''sú kam'').
;;; 18 Against unlucky marks.
1.18.1 Out we drive (''nir-sū'') the pallid sign, out the niggard; then, whatever things are excellent (''bhadrá''), those we lead together (?) for our progeny.
1.18.2 Savitar has driven out the trouble (? ''draṇi'') in her feet; out have Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman [driven] [that] in her hands; out hath Anumati, bestowing (''rā'') upon us; the gods have driven this woman forward unto good fortune.
1.18.3 Whatever in thy self, in thy body, is frightful, or what in hair or in mien - all that do we smite away with [our] words; let god Savitar advance (''sūd'') thee.
1.18.4 The antelope-footed, the bull-toothed, the kine-repelling, the out-blowing, the licked-out, the pallid - these we make disappear from us.
;;; 19 Against enemies.
1.19.1 Let not the piercers find us, nor let the penetraters find [us]; far from us make the volleys (''çaravyā̀'') fly, dispersing, O Indra.
1.19.2 Dispersing from us let the shafts fly, those that are hurled and that are to be hurled; ye divine arrows of men (''manuṣyà-''), pierce my enemies.
1.19.3 Whether one of our own or whether a stranger, fellow or outsider, whoso assails (''abhi-dās'') us - let Rudra with a volley pierce those my enemies.
1.19.4 Whatever rival (''sapátna''), whatever non-rival, and whatever hater shall curse us, him let all the gods damage (''dhūrv''); incantation (''bráhman'') is my inner defense.
;;; 20 Against enemies and their weapons.

1.20.3 Both what [is] from here and what from yonder - keep off, O Varuṇa, the deadly weapon; extend great protection (''çárman''); keep very far off the deadly weapon.
1.20.4 Verily a great ruler (''çāsá'') art thou, overpowerer of enemies, unsubdued, whose companion (''sákhi'') is not slain, is not scathed (''jyā'') at any time.
;;; 21 Against enemies.
1.21.1 Giver of well-being, lord of the people (''víç''), Vṛtra-slayer, remover of scorners, controlling, let the bull Indra go before us, soma-drinker, producing fearlessness.
1.21.2 Smite away, O Indra, our scorners (''mṛ́dh''); put (''yam'') down them that fight (''pṛtany'') [us]; make go to lowest darkness whoso vexes us.
1.21.3 Smite away the demon, away the scorners; break apart Vṛtra's (two) jaws; away, O Indra, Vṛtra-slayer, the fury of the vexing enemy.

1.22.2 With red colors we enclose thee, in order to length of life; that this man may be free from complaints (''-rápas''), also may become not yellow.
1.22.3 They that have the red one for divinity, and the kine that are red - form after form, vigor (''váyas'') after vigor, with them we enclose thee.
1.22.4 In the parrots, in the ''ropaṇā́kās'', we put thy yellowness; likewise in the ''hā́ridravas'' we deposit thy yellowness.
;;; 23 Against leprosy: with a healing herb.
1.23.1 Night-born art thou, O herb, O dark, black, [and] dusky one; O colorer (''rajanī''), do thou color this leprous spot and what is pale (''palitá'').
1.23.2 The leprous spot, what is pale, do thou cause to disappear from hence, the speckled; let thine own color enter thee; make white things (''çuklá'') fly away.
1.23.3 Dusky is thy hiding-place, dusky thy station (''āsthā́na''); dusky art thou, O herb; make the speckled disappear from hence.
1.23.4 Of the bone-born leprous spot, and of the body-born that is in the skin, of that made by the spoiler (''dū́ṣi'') - by incantation have I made the white (''çvetá'') mark disappear.
;;; 24 Against leprosy.
1.24.1 The eagle (''suparṇá'') was born first; of it thou wast the gall; then the Asura-woman, conquered by fight (''yúdh''), took shape as forest-trees.
1.24.2 The Asura-woman first made this remedy for leprous spot, this effacer of leprous spot; it has made the leprous spot disappear, has made the skin uniform (''sárūpa'').
1.24.3 Uniform by name is thy mother; uniform by name is thy father; uniform-making art thou, O herb; so do thou make this uniform.
1.24.4 The swarthy, uniform-making one [is] brought up off the earth; do thou accomplish this, we pray; make the forms right again.
;;; 25 Against fever (''takmán'').
1.25.1 As Agni, entering, burned the waters, where the maintainers of duty (''dhárma-'') paid acts of homage, there they declare to be thy highest birth-place; then do thou, O fever (''takmán''), complaisant, avoid us.
1.25.2 If thou art flame (''arcís'') or if heat (''çocís''), or if thy birth-place seeks the shavings (?), ''hrū́ḍu'' by name art thou, O god of the yellow one; then do thou, O fever, complaisant, avoid us.
1.25.3 If heating (''çoká'') or if scorching (''abhiçoká''), or if thou art son of king Varuṇa, ''hrúḍu'' by name art thou, O god of the yellow one; then do thou, O fever, complaisant, avoid us.

1.27.2 Let the cutting one (''kṛt'') go asunder, she who bears as it were a club (''pínăka''); asunder [go] the mind of her that returns to life (''punarbhú''); unsuccessful [are] the malignant ones.
1.27.3 The many have not been able together; the few have not ventured on [it]; like the sprouts (? ''ádga)'' of a bamboo (''veṇú'') round about, unsuccessful [are] the malignant ones.

1.30.4 Whose are the fore-offerings and whose the after-offerings; the gods that share the oblation and that eat what is not made oblation of; you among whom the five directions are shared out - you do I make sitters at the session (''sattrá-'') of this man.
;;; 31 To the divine guardians of the quarters.
1.31.1 To the four immortal region-guardians of the regions (''áçā''), to the overseers of existence (''bhūtá''), would we now pay worship (''vidh'') with oblation.
1.31.2 Ye, O gods, who are the four region-guardians of the regions - do ye release us from the fetters (''pā́ça'') of perdition (''nírṛti''), from every distress (''áṅhas'').

1.32.3 What the (two) quaking firmaments (''ródasī'') - and the earth - fashioned out, that at present is always wet, like the streams of the ocean.

1.35.1 What gold the descendants of Dakṣa, well-willing, bound on for Çatānīka, that I bind for thee, in order to life (''ā́yus''), splendor, strength, to length of life for a hundred autumns.
1.35.2 Not demons, not ''piçācás'' overcome him, for this is the first-born force of the gods; whoso bears the gold of the descendants of Dakṣa, he makes for himself long life among the living.
1.35.3 The waters' brilliancy, light, force, and strength, also the heroic powers (''vīryà'') of the forest trees, do we maintain in him, as in Indra Indra's powers (''indriyá''); this gold shall he, being capable, bear.

;;; 1 Mystic.
2.1.1 Vena (the longing one?) saw that which is highest in secret, where everything becomes of one form; this the spotted one (''pṛ́çni'') milked [when] born; the heaven-(''svàr''-)knowing troops (''vrá'') have shouted at it.
2.1.2 May the Gandharva, knowing of the immortal, proclaim that highest abode that is in secret; three quarters (''padá'') of it [are] deposited in secret; whoso knoweth them, he shall be the father's father.
2.1.3 He, of us the father, the generator, and he the connection (''bándhu''), knoweth the abodes, the beings all; who of the gods is the sole nomenclator, of him all beings come to inquire.
2.1.4 About heaven-and-earth at once I went; I approached (''upa-sthā'') the first-born of righteousness (''ṛtá''), abiding in beings as speech in the speaker; eager (?) is he; is he not Agni (fire)?
2.1.5 Around all beings I went, the web (''tántu'') of righteousness stretched out for beholding, where the gods, having attained immortality (''amṛ́ta'') bestirred themselves (?''īraya-'') upon the same place of union (''yóni'').
;;; 2 To Gandharvas and Apsarases.
2.2.1 The heavenly Gandharva, who is lord of being (''bhúvana''), the only one to receive homage, to be praised (''īḍ'') among the clans (''víç'') - thee being such I ban (''yu'') with incantation, O heavenly god; homage be to thee; in the heaven is thy station.
2.2.2 Touching the sky, worshipful, sun-skinned, deprecator of the seizure (''háras'') of the gods - gracious shall be the Gandharva, who is lord of being, the only one to receive homage, very propitious.
2.2.3 He hath united himself (''sam-gam'') with those irreproachable ones (f.); in (''ápi'') among the Apsarases was the Gandharva; in the ocean is, they tell me, their seat, whence at once they both come and go.
2.2.4 O cloudy one, gleamer (''didyút''), starry one - ye that accompany (''sac'') the Gandharva Viçvāvasu, to you there, O divine ones, homage do I pay.
2.2.5 They that are noisy, dusky, dice-loving, mind-confusing - to those Apsarases, that have the Gandharvas for spouses, have I paid homage.
;;; 3 For relief from flux: with a certain remedy.
2.3.1 What runs down yonder, aiding (?), off the mountain, that do I make for thee a remedy, that thou mayest be a good remedy.
2.3.2 Now then, forsooth! how then, forsooth? what hundred remedies are thine, of them art thou the chief (''uttamá''), free from flux, free from disease (''árogaṇa'').
2.3.3 The Asuras dig low down this great wound-healer; that is the remedy of flux; that has made the disease (''róga'') disappear.
2.3.4 The ants (''upajī́kā'') bring up the remedy from out the ocean; that is the remedy of flux; that has quieted (''çam'') the disease.
2.3.5 This is a great wound-healer, brought up from out the earth; that is the remedy of the flux; that has made the disease disappear.
2.3.6 Weal be to us the waters, propitious the herbs; let Indra's thunderbolt smite away the demoniacs {''rakṣás''); far away let the discharged arrows of the demoniacs fly.
;;; 4 Against various evils: with a jan̄giḍá amulet.
2.4.1 In order to length of life, to great joy, we, taking no harm, all the time capable (''dakṣ''), bear the ''jan̄giḍá'', the ''víṣkandha''-spoiling amulet.
2.4.2 From ''jambá'', from ''viçará'', from ''víṣkandha'', from scorching (''abhiçócana''), let the ''jan̄giḍá'', the amulet of thousand-fold valiance (''-vīryà''), protect us about on every side.
2.4.3 This one overpowers the ''víṣkandha;'' this drives off the devourers; let this ''jan̄giḍá'', possessing all remedies, protect us from distress.
2.4.4 With the amulet given by the gods, the kindly ''jan̄giḍá'', we overpower in the struggle (''vyāyāmá'') the ''víṣkandha'' [and] all demons.
2.4.5 Let both the hemp and the ''jan̄giḍá'' defend me from the ''víṣkandha'': the one brought from the forest, the other from the juices (''rása'') of ploughing.
2.4.6 Witchcraft-spoiling is this amulet, likewise niggard-spoiling; likewise shall the pov/eriul ''jan̄giḍá'' prolong our life-times.
;;; 5 Praise and prayer to Indra.
2.5.1 O Indra, enjoy thou - drive on; - come, O hero - with thy two bays; - drink of the pressed [soma] - intoxicated here - loving the sweet [draught], fair one, unto intoxication.
2.5.2 O Indra, [thy] belly - like one to be praised - fill thou with the sweet [draught] - like the heavens - with this soma - like the sky (''svàr'') - ; unto thee have gone the well-voiced intoxications.
2.5.3 Indra, a swiftly-overcoming friend, who slew Vritra - like moving [streams] - , [who] split Vala - like Bhṛgu - , who overpowered his foes in the intoxication of soma.
2.5.4 Let the pressed [somas] enter thee, O Indra; fill thy (two) paunches; help, O mighty one! for our prayer (''dhī́'') come to us; hear [my] call, enjoy my songs; hither, O Indra, with self-harnessed [steeds]; revel here unto great joy.
2.5.5 Now will I proclaim the heroisms of Indra, which first he of the thunderbolt (''vajrín'') did; he slew the dragon (''áhi''); he penetrated to the waters; he split forth the bellies (''vakṣáṇā'') of the mountains.
2.5.6 He slew the dragon that had resorted (''çri'') to the mountain; Tvashṭar fashioned for him the whizzing (?) thunderbolt; like lowing kine, flowing (''syand''), at once the waters went down to the ocean.
2.5.7 Acting like a bull, he chose the soma; he drank of the pressed [draught] in the ''tríkadrukas;'' the bounteous one (''maghávan'') took his missile thunderbolt; he slew that first-born of dragons.
;;; 6 Praise and prayer to Agni.
2.6.1 Let the summers (''sámā''), O Agni, the seasons, increase thee, the years, the seers, what things are true; shine thou with the heavenly bright space (''rocaná''); illuminate (''ā-bhā'') all the four directions.
2.6.2 Both do thou become kindled, Agni, and do thou increase this man, and arise unto great good fortune; let not thine attendants (''upasattár'') be harmed, O Agni; be thy worshipers (''brahmán'') glorious, not others.
2.6.3 Thee, O Agni, do these Brahmans choose; be propitious to us, O Agni, in the [sacrificial] enclosure (? ''saṁváraṇa''); rival-slayer, Agni, conqueror of hostile plotters, be thou; watch unremitting over thine own household.
2.6.4 Take hold of thine own dominion (''kṣatrá''), Agni; with [thy] friend, Agni, strive (''yat'') in friendly wise; [as one] of midmost station among [his] fellows (''sajātá''), [as one] to be severally invoked of kings, Agni, shine thou here.
2.6.5 Over enviers, over delinquents, over the thoughtless, over haters, - verily all difficult things, O Agni, do thou cross; then mayest thou give us wealth accompanied with heroes.
;;; 7 Against curses and cursers: with a plant.
2.7.1 Hated by mischief, god-born, the curse-effacing plant hath washed away from me all curses, as waters do filth.
2.7.2 Both the curse that is a rival's, and the curse that is a sister's, what a priest (? ''brahmán'') from fury may curse - all that [be] underneath our feet.
2.7.3 From the sky [is] the root stretched down, from off the earth stretched up; with this, thousand-jointed (''-kā́ṇḍa''), do thou protect us about on all sides.
2.7.4 Protect me about, my progeny, [and] what riches are ours; let not the niggard get the better (''tṛ'') of us; let not hostile plotters get the better of us.
2.7.5 Let the curse go to the curser; our [part] is along with him that is friendly (''suhā́rd''); of the eye-conjurer (''-mántra''), the unfriendly, we crush in the ribs (''pṛṣṭí'').
;;; 8 Against the disease kṣetriyá: with a plant.

2.8.3 With the straw of the brown, whitish-jointed barley for thee, with the sesame-stalk (? ''-piñjī'') of sesame, let the ''kṣetriyá''-effacing (''-nā́çana) plant fade the ''kṣetriyá'' away.
2.8.4 Homage to thy ploughs (''lān̄gala''), homage to thy poles-and-yokes: let the ''kṣetriyá''-effacing (''-nā́çana) plant fade the ''kṣetriyá'' away.
2.8.5 Homage to them of constantly falling eyes, homage to them of the same region (? ''saṁdeçyà''), homage to the lord of the field: let the ''kṣetriyá''-effacing (''-nā́çana) plant fade the ''kṣetriyá'' away.

2.9.2 This man hath come, hath arisen, hath gone unto the troop (''vrā́ta'') of the living; he hath become of sons the father and of men (''nṛ́'') the most fortunate.
2.9.3 He hath attained (''adhi-gā'') attainments; he hath attained (''adhi-gam'') the strongholds (''-purā'') of the living; for a hundred healers are his, also a thousand plants.
2.9.4 The gods have found thy gathering (? ''cītí''), the priests (''brahmán'') and the plants; all the gods have found thy gathering upon the earth.

2.26.1 Hither let the cattle come that went away, whose companionship (''sahacārá'') Vāyu (the wind) enjoyed, whose form-givings Tvashṭar knows; in this cow-stall let Savitar make them fast (''ni-yam'').
2.26.2 To this cow-stall let cattle flow-together stream together (''sam-sru''); let Brihaspati, foreknowing, lead them hither; let Sinīvālī lead hither the van (''ágra'') of them; make them fast when they have come, O Anumati.
2.26.3 Together, together let cattle flow stream, together horses, and together men, together the fatness that is of grain; I offer with an oblation of confluence.
2.26.4 I pour together the milk (''kṣīrá'') of kine, together strength, sap, with sacrificial butter; poured together are our heroes; fixed are the kine in me rather, with me [as] kine-lord.
2.26.5 I bring (''ā-hṛ'') the milk of kine; I have brought the sap of grain; brought are our heroes, our wives, to this home (''ástaka'').
;;; 27 For victory in disputation: with a plant.
2.27.1 May [my] foe by no means win (''ji'') the dispute; overpowering, overcoming art thou; smite the dispute of [my] counter-disputant; make them sapless, O herb.
2.27.2 The eagle discovered (''anu-vid'') thee; the swine dug thee with his snout: smite the dispute of [my] counter-disputant; make them sapless, O herb.
2.27.3 Indra put (''kŗ'') thee on his arm, in order to lay low (''stŗ'') the Asuras: smite the dispute of [my] counter-disputant; make them sapless, O herb.
2.27.4 Indra consumed (''vi-aç'') the ''pāṭá'', in order to lay low the Asuras: smite the dispute of [my] counter-disputant; make them sapless, O herb.
2.27.5 With it will I overpower the foes, as Indra did the ''sālāvṛkás:'' smite the dispute of [my] counter-disputant; make them sapless, O herb.
2.27.6 O Rudra, thou of healing (?) remedies, of dark (''nī́la'') crests, deed-doer! smite the dispute of [my] counter-disputant; make them sapless, O herb.
2.27.7 Do thou smite the dispute of him, O Indra, who vexes us; bless us with abilities (''çákti''); make me superior in the dispute.
;;; 28 For long life for a certain person (child?).
2.28.1 For just thee, O old age, let this one grow; let not the other deaths, that are a hundred, harm him; as a forethoughtful mother in her lap a son, let Mitra protect him from distress that comes from a friend (''mitríya'').
2.28.2 Let Mitra or helpful (? ''riçā́dās'') Varuṇa in concord make him one that dies of old age; so Agni the offerer (''hótar''), knowing the ways (''vayúna''), bespeaks all the births of the gods.
2.28.3 Thou art master (''īç'') of earthly cattle, that are born, or also that are to be born; let not breath leave this one, nor expiration; let not friends slay (''vadh'') this one, nor enemies.
2.28.4 Let father heaven, let mother earth, in concord, make thee one that dies of old age; that thou mayest live in the lap of Aditi, guarded by breath and expiration, a hundred winters.
2.28.5 This one, O Agni, do thou lead for life-time, for splendor, to dear seed, O Varuṇa, Mitra, king! like a mother, O Aditi, yield (''yam'') him refuge; O all ye gods, that he be one reaching old age.
;;; 29 For some one's long life and other blessings.
2.29.1 In the sap of what is earthly, O gods, in the strength of Bhaga's self (''tanū́'') - length of life to this man may Agni, Sūrya - splendor may Brihaspati impart.
2.29.2 Length of life to him assign thou, O Jātavedas; progeny, O Tvashṭar, do thou bestow on him; abundance of wealth, O Savitar ('impeller'), do thou impel to him; may he live a hundred autumns of thee.
2.29.3 Our blessing [assign him] refreshment, possession of excellent progeny; do ye (two), accordant, assign [him] dexterity, property (''dráviṇa''); [let] this man [be] conquering fields with power, O Indra, putting (''kṛ'') other rivals beneath him.
2.29.4 Given by Indra, instructed by Varuṇa, sent forth by the Maruts, hath the formidable one come to us; let this man, in your lap, O heaven-and-earth, not hunger, not thirst.
2.29.5 Assign refreshment to him, ye (two) that are rich in refreshment; assign milk to him, ye rich in milk; refreshment have heaven-and-earth assigned to him, [have] all the gods, the Maruts, refreshment [have] the waters.
2.29.6 With propitious things (f.) I gratify thy heart; mayest thou enjoy thyself (''mud'') free from disease, very splendid; let the two that dwell together (? ''savāsín'') drink this stir-about (''manthá''), putting on [as] magic the form of the (two) Açvins.
2.29.7 Indra in the beginning, being pierced, created this refreshment, [this] unaging ''svadhā́;'' it is thine here; by it live thou for autumns, very splendid; be there no flux of thee; the healers have made [it] for thee.
;;; 30 To secure a woman's love.
2.30.1 As the wind here shakes the grass off the earth, so do I shake thy mind, that thou mayest be one loving me, that thou mayest be one not going away from me.
2.30.2 May ye, O Açvins, both lead together and bring [her] together with him who loves her. The fortunes (''bhága'') of you (two) have come together, together [your] intents, together [your] courses (''vratá'').
2.30.3 What the eagles [are] wanting to say, the free from disease [are] wanting to say - there let her come to my call, as the tip to the neck of the arrow (''kúlmala'').
2.30.4 What [was] within, [be] that without; what [was] without, [be] that within; of the maidens of many forms seize thou the mind, O herb.
2.30.5 Hither hath this woman come, desiring a husband; desiring a wife have I come; like a loud-neighing (''krand'') horse, together with fortune have I come.
;;; 31 Against worms.
2.31.1 The great mill-stone that is Indra's, bruiser (''tárhaṇa'') of every worm - with that I mash (''piṣ'') together the worms, as ''khálva''-grains with a mill-stone.
2.31.2 The seen, the unseen one have I bruised, also the ''kurū́ru'' have I bruised; all the ''algáṇḍus'', the ''çalúnas'', the worms we grind up with our spell (''vácas'').
2.31.3 I smite the ''algáṇḍus'' with a great deadly weapon; burnt [or] unburnt, they have become sapless; those left [or] not left I draw down by my spell (''vā́c''), that no one of the worms be left.
2.31.4 The one along the entrails, the one in the head, likewise the worm in the ribs, the ''avaskavá'', the ''vyadhvará'' - the worms we grind up with our spell (''vácas'').
2.31.5 The worms that are in the mountains, in the woods, in the herbs, in the cattle, within the waters, that have entered our selves (''tanū́'') - that whole generation (''jåniman'') of worms I smite.
;;; 32 Against worms.
2.32.1 Let the sun (''ādityá''), rising, smite the worms; setting, let him smite [them] with his rays - the worms that are within the cow.
2.32.2 The worm of all forms, the four-eyed, the variegated, the whitish - I crush (''çṛ'') the ribs of it; I hew at (''api-vraçc'') what is its head.
2.32.3 Like Atri I slay you, O worms, like Kaṇva, like Jamadagni; with the incantation of Agastya I mash together the worms.
2.32.4 Slain is the king of the worms, also the chief (''sthapáti'') of them is slain; slain is the worm, having its mother slain, its brother slain, its sister slain.
2.32.5 Slain are its neighbors (? ''veçás''), slain its further neighbors (? ''páriveças''), also those that are petty (''kṣullaká), as it were - all those worms are slain.
2.32.6 I crush up (''pra-çṛ'') thy (two) horns, with which thou thrustest; I split thy receptacle (?), which is thy poison-holder.
;;; 33 For expulsion of yákṣma from all parts of the body.
2.33.1 Forth from thy (two) eyes, (two) nostrils, (two) ears, chin, brain, tongue, I eject (''vi-vṛh'') for thee the ''yákṣma'' of the head.
2.33.2 From thy neck (''grīvás''), nape (''uṣṇíhās''), vertebræ (''kī́kasā''), backbone, (two) shoulders, (two) fore-arms, I eject for thee the ''yákṣma'' of the arms.
2.33.3 Forth from thy heart, lung (''klomán''), ''hálīkṣṇa'', (two) sides, (two) ''mátasnas'', spleen, liver, we eject for thee the ''yákṣma.''
2.33.4 Forth from thine entrails, guts, rectum, belly, (two) paunches, ''plāçí'', navel, I eject for thee the ''yákṣma.''
2.33.5 From thy (two) thighs, knees, heels, front feet, hips, fundament (? ''bháṅsas''), I eject for thee the ''yákṣma'' of the rump.
2.33.6 From thy bones, marrows, sinews, vessels, (two) hands, fingers, nails, I eject for thee the ''yákṣma.''
2.33.7 What [''yákṣma'' is] in thine every limb, every hair, every joint - the ''yákṣma'' of thy skin do we, with Kaçyapa's ejector (''vībarhá'') eject away (''víṣvañc'').
;;; 34 Accompanying the sacrifice of an animal.
2.34.1 The lord of cattle, who rules over (''īç'') the cattle, the four-footed, and who also over the two-footed - let him, bought off, go to [his] sacrificial portion; let abundances of wealth attach themselves to (''sac'') the sacrificer.
2.34.2 Do ye, releasing (''pra-muc'') the seed of being, assign progress (''gātú'') to the sacrificer, O gods; what hath stood brought hither (''upákṛta''), strenuous (''çaçamāná''), let it go upon the dear path of the gods.
2.34.3 They who, giving attention to (''anu-dhī'') the one being bound, looked after [him] with mind and with eye - let the divine Agni at first (''ágre'') release them, he the all-working, in unison with (''saṁ-rā'') progeny.
2.34.4 The cattle that are of the village, all-formed, being of various forms, manifoldly of one form - let the divine Vāyu at first release them, Prajāpati, in unison with progeny.
2.34.5 Foreknowing, let them first (''pū́rva'') receive the breath (''prāṇá'') coming to [them] forth from the limbs. Go to heaven; stand firm with thy bodies; go to paradise (''svargá'') by god-traveled roads.
;;; 35 To expiate errors in the sacrifice: to Viçvakarman.
2.35.1 They who, partaking [of soma] (''bhakṣ''), did not prosper (''ṛdh'') in good things, whom the fires of the sacrificial hearth were distressed about (''anu-tapya-'') - what was the expiation (''avayá'') of their ill-sacrifice, may Viçvakarman ('the all-worker') make that for us a good sacrifice.
2.35.2 The seers declare the master (''-páti'') of the sacrifice by reason of sin disportioned, distressed about [his] offspring. What honeyed drops he offended in (? ''apa-rādh''), with them let Viçvakarman unite (''sam-sṛj'') us.
2.35.3 Thinking the soma-drinkers to be unworthy of gifts (? ''adānyá''), [though] knowing of the sacrifice, [he is] not wise (''dhī́ra'') in the conjuncture (''samayá''); in that this man is bound having committed a sin, do thou, O Viçvakarman, release him for his well-being.
2.35.4 Terrible [are] the seers; homage be to them! what sight [is] theirs, and the actuality (''satyá'') of their mind. For Brihaspati, O bull (''mahiṣá''), [be] bright (''dyumánt'') homage; O Viçvakarman, homage to thee! protect thou us.
2.35.5 The sacrifice's eye, commencement, and face: with voice, hearing, mind I make oblation. To this sacrifice, extended by Viçvakarman, let the gods come, well-willing.
;;; 36 To get a husband for a woman.
2.36.1 Unto our favor, O Agni, may a wooer come, to this girl, along with our fortune (''bhága''). Enjoyable (''juṣṭá'') [is she] to suitors (''vará''), agreeable at festivals (''sámana''); be there quickly good-fortune for her with a husband.
2.36.2 Fortune enjoyed by Soma, enjoyed by Brahman, brought together by Aryaman; with the truth of divine Dhātar, the husband-finder I perform (''kṛ'').
2.36.3 May this woman, O Agni, find a husband; for king Soma maketh her of good-fortune; giving birth to sons, she shall become chief consort (''máhiṣī''); having gone to a husband, let her, having good-fortune, bear rule (''vi-rāj'').
2.36.4 As, O bounteous one (''maghávan''), this pleasant covert hath been dear to the well-settled (''suṣád'') wild beasts, so let this woman be enjoyed of Bhaga, mutually dear, not disagreeing with her husband.
2.36.5 Ascend thou the boat of Bhaga, full, unfailing; with that cause to cross over hither a suitor who is according to thy wish.
2.36.6 Shout to [him], O lord of riches; make a suitor hither-minded; turn the right side to every one who is a suitor according to thy wish.
2.36.7 Here [is] gold, bdellium; here [is] ''āukṣá'', likewise fortune; these have given thee unto husbands, in order to find one according to thy wish.
2.36.8 Hither let Savitar conduct for thee, conduct a husband that is according to thy wish; do thou assign [him] to her, O herb.
;;; 1 Against enemies.
3.1.1 Let Agni, knowing, go against our foes, burning against the imprecator, the niggard; let him confound (''mohaya-'') the army of our adversaries (''pára''); and may Jātavedas make them handless.
3.1.2 Ye, O Maruts, are formidable for such a plight; go forward upon [them], kill, overcome! The Vasus have killed [them]; suppliant [are] these; for let Agni, their messenger, go against [their foes], knowing.
3.1.3 The army of enemies, O bounteous one, playing the foe against us - do ye (two), O Vṛtra-slaying Indra, Agni also, burn against them.
3.1.4 Impelled, O Indra, forwards (? ''pravátā'') by thy (two) bays - let thy thunderbolt go forth, slaughtering (''pra-mṛ'') the foes; smite the on-coming, the following, the fleeing (''párāñc''); scatter their actual intent.
3.1.5 O Indra, confound the army of our enemies; with the blast of fire, of wind, make them disappear, scattering.
3.1.6 Let Indra confound the army; let the Maruts slay with force; let Agni take away its eyes; let it go back conquered.
;;; 2 Against enemies.
3.2.1 Let Agni our messenger, knowing, go against [them], burning against the imprecator, the niggard; let him confound the intents of our adversaries; and may Jātavedas make them handless.
3.2.2 Agni here hath confounded the intents that are in your heart; let him blow (''dham'') you away from [our] home; let him blow you forth in every direction.
3.2.3 O Indra! confounding [their] intents, move hitherward with [their] design (''ā́kūti''); with the blast of fire, of wind, make them disappear, scattering.
3.2.4 Go asunder, ye designs of them; also, ye intents, be confounded; also what is today in their heart, that smite thou out from them.
3.2.5 Confounding the intents of those yonder, seizing their limbs, O Apvā, go away; go forth against [them]; consume [them] in their hearts with pangs (''çóka''); pierce the enemies with seizure (''grā́hi''), the foes with darkness.
3.2.6 Yonder army of our adversaries, O Maruts, that comes contending against us with force - pierce ye it with baffling darkness, that one of them may not know another.
;;; 3 For the restoration of a king.
3.3.1 He hath shouted (? ''krand''); may he be protector of his own here; O Agni, bend apart the two widened firmaments (''ródasī''); let the all-possessing Maruts harness (''yuj'') thee; lead thou hither with homage yon man of bestowed oblation.
3.3.2 Indra, the inspired one, however far away, let the ruddy ones set in motion hither (''ā-cyāvaya-'') in order to friendship, when the gods venture (?) for him a ''gāyatrī́'', a ''bṛhatī́'', a song (''arká''), with the ''sāutrāmaṇī́'' (ceremony).
3.3.3 For the waters let king Varuṇa call thee; let Soma call thee for the mountains; let Indra call thee for these subjects (''víç''); becoming a falcon, fly unto these subjects.
3.3.4 Let the falcon lead hither from far (''pára'') the one to be called, living exiled in others' territory (''kṣétra''); let the (two) Açvins make the road for thee easy to go; settle together about this man, ye his fellows.
3.3.5 Let thine opponents call thee; thy friends have chosen [thee] against [them] (? ''práti''); Indra-and-Agni, all the gods, have maintained for thee security (''kṣéma'') in the people (''víç'').
3.3.6 Whatever fellow disputes thy call, and whatever outsider - making him go away (''ápāñc''), O Indra, then do thou reinstate (''ava-gamaya'') this man here.
;;; 4 To establish a king.
3.4.1 Unto thee hath come the kingdom; with splendor rise forward; [as] lord of the people (''víças''), sole king, bear thou rule (''vi-rāj''); let all the directions call thee, O king; become thou here one for waiting on, for homage.
3.4.2 Thee let the people (''víças'') choose unto kingship (''rājyà''), thee these five divine directions; rest (''çri'') at the summit of royalty, at the pinnacle (''kakúd''); from thence, formidable, share out good things to us.
3.4.3 Unto thee let thy fellows come, calling [thee]; Agni shall go along as speedy messenger; let the wives, the sons, be well-willing; thou, formidable, shalt see arrive (''prati-paç'') much tribute.
3.4.4 Let the (two) Açvins thee first, - let Mitra-and-Varuṇa both, let all the gods, the Maruts, call thee; then put (''kṛ'') thy mind unto the giving of good things; from thence, formidable, share out good things to us.
3.4.5 Run forth hither from the furthest distance; propitious to thee be heaven-and-earth both; king Varuṇa here saith this thus; he here hath called thee; therefore (''sá'') do thou come to this place.
3.4.6 Like a human Indra, go thou away; for thou hast concurred (''sam-jñā'') in concord with the castes (?); he here hath called thee in his own station; he shall sacrifice to the gods, and he shall arrange the people (''víças'').
3.4.7 The wealthy roads, of manifoldly various form, all, assembling, have made wide room for thee; let them all in concord call thee; to the tenth [decade of life] abide here formidable, well-willing.
;;; 5 For prosperity: with a parṇá-amulet.
3.5.1 Hither hath come this ''parṇá''-amulet, strong, by strength slaughtering our rivals; force of the gods, milk of the herbs, let it quicken me with splendor unremittingly.
3.5.2 In me [maintain] dominion, O ''parṇá''-amulet, in me maintain wealth; may I in the sphere of royalty be familiar (? ''nijá''), supreme.
3.5.3 The dear amulet which the gods deposited hidden in the forest-tree - that let the gods give to us to wear, together with length of life (''ā́yus'').
3.5.4 The ''parṇá'', Soma's formidable power, hath come, given by Indra, governed (''çās'') by Varuṇa; may I, shining greatly, wear it in order to length of life for a hundred autumns.
3.5.5 The ''parṇá''-amulet hath ascended me, in order to great unharmedness, so that I may be superior to patron (''aryamán'') and to ally (''saṁvíd'').
3.5.6 They that are clever chariot-makers, that are skilful smiths - subjects to me do thou, O ''parṇá'', make all people (''jána'') round about.
3.5.7 They that are kings, king-makers, that are charioteers and troop-leaders - subjects to me do thou, O ''parṇá'', make all people round about.
3.5.8 ''Parṇá'' art thou, body-protecting; a hero, from the same womb (''yóni'') with me a hero; with the year's brilliancy - therewith I bind thee on, O amulet.
;;; 6 Against enemies: with açvatthá.
3.6.1 The male (''púmāṅs'') [is] born out of the male - the ''açvatthá'' forth from the ''khadirá;'' let it smite my foes, whom I hate and who [hate] me.
3.6.2 Crush them out, O ''açvatthá'', our violent foes, O expelling one, allied with Vṛtra-slaying Indra, with Mitra, and with Varuṇa.
3.6.3 As thou, O ''açvatthá'', didst break out [the ''khadirá''] within the great sea, so do thou break out all these, whom I hate and who [hate] me.
3.6.4 Thou that goest about overpowering, like a bull that has overpowered - with thee here, O ''açvatthá'', may we overpower our rivals.
3.6.5 Let perdition bind them, with unreleasable fetters of death - my foes, O ''açvatthá'', whom I hate and who [hate] me.
3.6.6 As, O ''açvatthá'', ascending them of the forest-trees, thou dost put them beneath thee (''ádhara''), so the head of my foe do thou split apart and overcome.
3.6.7 Let them float forth downward, like a boat severed from its mooring (''bándhana''); of them, thrust forth by the expelling one, there is no returning again.
3.6.8 I thrust them forth with mind, forth with intent and incantation; forth with branch of tree, of ''açvatthá'', we thrust them.
;;; 7 Against the disease kṣetriyá.
3.7.1 On the head of the swift-running gazelle (''hariṇá'') is a remedy; he by his horn hath made the ''kṣetriyá'' disappear, dispersing.
3.7.2 After thee hath the bull-gazelle stridden with his four feet; O horn, do thou unfasten (''vi-sā'') the ''kṣetriyá'' that is compacted (?) in his heart.
3.7.3 What shines down yonder, like a four-sided roof (''chadís''), therewith we make all the ''kṣetriyá'' disappear from thy limbs.
3.7.4 The two blessed stars named Unfasteners (''vicṛ́t''), that are yonder in the sky - let them unfasten of the ''kṣetriyá'' the lowest, the highest fetter.
3.7.5 The waters verily [are] remedial, the waters disease-expelling, the waters remedial of everything; let them release thee from ''kṣetriyá''.
3.7.6 If from the drink (? ''āsutí'') that was being made the ''kṣetriyá'' hath come upon (''vi-aç'') thee, I know the remedy of it; I make the ''kṣetriyá'' disappear from thee.
3.7.7 In the fading-out of the asterisms, in the fading-out of the dawns also, from us [fade] out all that is of evil nature, fade out (''apa-vas'') the ''kṣetriyá.''
;;; 8 For authority.
3.8.1 Let Mitra come, arranging with the seasons, uniting (? ''sam-veçaya-'') the earth with the ruddy ones (''usríyā''); then to us let Varuṇa, Vāyu, Agni, assign great royalty of union (? ''saṁveçyà'').
3.8.2 Let Dhātar, Rāti, Savitar enjoy here (''idám''); let Indra, Tvashṭar, welcome my words (''vácas''); I call the divine Aditi, mother of heroes (''çū́ra-''), that I may be midmost man of my fellows.
3.8.3 I call, with acts of homage. Soma, Savitar, all the Ādityas, in the contest for preëminence; may this fire shine for very long, kindled by [my] fellows who gainsay not.
3.8.4 May ye be just here; may ye not go away (''parás''); may an active herdsman (''gopā́''), lord of prosperity, drive you hither; do ye, with [your] desires, [attend] upon (?) his desire; let all the gods conduct you together hither.
3.8.5 We bend together your minds, together your courses (''vratá''), together your designs; ye yonder who are of discordant courses, we make you bend [them] together here.
3.8.6 I seize [your] minds with [my] mind; come ye after my intent with [your] intents; I put your hearts in my control; come with [your] tracks following my motion (''yātá'').
;;; 9 Against viṣkandha and other evils.
3.9.1 Of the ''karçápha'', of the ''viçaphá'', heaven [is] father, earth mother: as, O gods, ye have inflicted (''abhi-kṛ''), so do ye remove (''apa-kṛ'') again.
3.9.2 Without claspers they held fast (''dhāraya''); that was so done by Manu; I make the ''víṣkandha'' impotent, like a castrater of bulls.
3.9.3 On a reddish string a ''khṛ́gala'' - that the pious (''vedhás'') bind on; let the binders (?) make impotent the flowing (?), puffing (?) ''kābavá''.
3.9.5 Wherewith, O flowing ones, ye go about (''car''), like gods with Asura-magic (''-māyā''), like the ape, spoiler of dogs, and with the binder (?) of the ''kābavá.''
3.9.5 Since I shall bind thee [on] for spoiling, I shall spoil the ''kābavá;'' ye shall go up with curses, like swift chariots.
3.9.6 A hundred and one ''víṣkandhas'' [are] distributed over the earth; thee have they first taken up, of them the ''víṣkandha-''spoiling amulet.
;;; 10 To the ekāṣṭakā́ (day of moon's last quarter).
3.10.1 She first shone out; she became a milch-cow at Yama's; let her, rich in milk, yield (''duh'') to us each further summer (? ''sámā'').
3.10.2 The night which the gods rejoice to meet, [as] a milch-cow coming unto [them], which is the spouse (''pátnī'') of the year - let her be very auspicious to us.
3.10.3 Thou, O night, whom we worship (''upa-ās'') as model (''pratimā́'') of the year- - do thou unite our long-lived progeny with abundance of wealth.
3.10.4 This same is she that first shone out; among these other ones (f.) she goes about (''car''), having entered; great greatnesses [are] within her; the bride (''vadhū́''), the new-going generatrix, hath conquered.
3.10.5 The forest-tree pressing-stones have made their sound, making the oblation of the complete year (''parivatsarī́ṇa''); O sole ''áṣṭakā'', may we, having good progeny and good heroes, be lords of wealths.
3.10.6 The track (''padá'') of Idā [is] full of ghee, greatly trickling; O Jātavedas, accept thou the oblations. The cattle of the village that are of all forms - of those seven let the willing stay (''ráṁti'') be with me.
3.10.7 [Set] thou me in both prosperity and abundance; O night, may we be in the favor of the gods. O spoon, fly away full; fly back hither well-filled; jointly enjoying all sacrifices, bring to us food (''íṣ''), refreshment (''ū́rj'').
3.10.8 Hither hath come the year, thy spouse, O sole ''áṣṭakā;'' do thou unite our long-lived progeny with abundance of wealth.
3.10.9 I sacrifice to the seasons, the lords of the seasons, them of the seasons (''ārtavá''), and the winters (''hāyaná''), to the summers (''sámā''), the years, the months; for the lord of existence I sacrifice.
3.10.10 To thee for the seasons, them of the seasons, the months, the years, the Creator (''dhātár''), the Disposer (''vidhātár''), the Prosperer (? ''samṛ́dh''), the lord of existence, do I sacrifice.
3.10.11 We, making oblation with ''ídā'' - I sacrifice to the gods with what is rich in ghee; unto houses not disorderly (? ''álubhyant''), rich in kine, may we enter together.
3.10.12 The sole ''áṣṭakā'', paining herself (''tapyá-'') with penance, generated an embryo, a greatness, Indra; by him the gods overcame their foes; slayer of the barbarians became the lord of might (''çácī-'').
3.10.13 Thou whose son is Indra, whose son is Soma, daughter art thou of Prajāpati; fulfil thou our desires; accept our oblation.
;;; 11 For relief from disease, and for long life.
3.11.1 I release thee by oblation, in order to living, from unknown ''yákṣma'' and from royal ''yákṣma;'' if now seizure (''gráhi'') hath seized him, from it, O Indra-and-Agni, do ye release him.
3.11.2 If of exhausted life-time, or if deceased, if gone down even to the presence (''antiká'') of death, him I take from the lap of perdition; I have won (''spṛ'') him for [life] of a hundred autumns.
3.11.3 With an oblation having a thousand eyes, a hundred heroisms, a hundred life-times, have I taken him, in order that Indra may lead him unto autumns, across to the further shore of all difficulty (''duritá'').
3.11.4 Live thou increasing a hundred autumns, a hundred winters, and a hundred springs; a hundred to thee [may] Indra, Agni, Savitar, Brihaspati [give]; with an oblation of a hundred life-times have I taken him.
3.11.5 Enter in, O breath-and-expiration, as two draft-oxen a pen (''vrajá''); let the other deaths go away (''ví''), which they call the remaining hundred.
3.11.6 Be ye just here, O breath-and-expiration; go ye not away from here; carry his body, his limbs, unto old age again.
3.11.7 Unto old age do I commit thee; unto old age do I shake thee down (''ni-dhū''); may old age, excellent, conduct thee; let the other deaths go away, which they call the remaining hundred.
3.11.8 Old age hath curbed (''abhi-dhā'') thee, as it were a cow, an ox, with a rope; the death that curbed thee, when born, with easy fetter - that Brihaspati released for thee, with the (two) hands of truth.
;;; 12 Accompanying the building of a house.
3.12.1 Just here I fix (''ni-mi'') [my] dwelling (''çā́lā'') firm; may it stand in security, sprinkling ghee; unto thee here, O dwelling, may we resort (''sam-car'') with all our heroes, with good heroes, with unharmed heroes.
3.12.2 Just here stand thou firm, O dwelling, rich in horses, in kine, in pleasantness, in refreshment, in ghee, in milk; erect thyself (''ut-çri'') in order to great good-fortune.
3.12.3 A garner (? ''dharunī́'') art thou, O dwelling, of great roof, of cleansed grain; to thee may the calf come, may the boy, may the kine, streaming in at evening.
3.12.4 This dwelling let Savitar, Vayu, Indra, Brihaspati fix, foreknowing; let the Maruts sprinkle it with water, with ghee; let king Bhaga deepen (''ni-tan'') our ploughing.
3.12.5 O mistress of the building (? ''mā́na''), as sheltering, pleasant, hast thou, a goddess, been fixed by the gods in the beginning; clothing thyself in grass, mayest thou be well-willing; then mayest thou give us wealth together with heroes.
3.12.6 With due order, O beam (''vaṅçá''), ascend the post; formidable, bearing rule, force away (''apa-vṛj'') the foes; let not the attendants (''upasattár'') of thy houses be harmed, O dwelling; may we live a hundred autumns with all our heroes.
3.12.7 To it the tender boy, to it the calf, with moving creatures (''jágat''), to it the jar of ''parisrút'', with mugs of curd, have come.
3.12.8 Bring forward, O woman, this full jar, a stream of ghee combined (''sam-bhṛ'') with ambrosia (''amṛ́ta''); anoint these drinkers (?) with ambrosia; let what is offered-and-bestowed defend it (f.: the dwelling?).
3.12.9 These waters I bring forward, free from ''yákṣma, yákṣma''-effacing; I set forth (? ''pra-sad'') unto (''úpa'') the houses, along with immortal (''amṛ́ta'') fire.
;;; 13 To the waters.
3.13.1 Since formerly (? ''adás''), going forth together, ye resounded (''nad'') when the dragon was slain, thenceforth ye are streams (''nadī́'') by name: these are your names, O rivers.
3.13.2 When, sent forth by Varuna, ye thereupon (''ā́t'') quickly skipped (''valg'') together, then Indra obtained (''āp'') you as ye went; therefore are ye waters (''ā́p'') afterward.
3.13.3 As ye were flowing perversely (''apakāmám''), since Indra verily hindered (''var'') you by his powers, you, ye divine ones, therefore the name water (''vā́r'') is assigned you.
3.13.4 The one god stood up to you, flowing at [your] will; "the great ones have breathed up (''ud-an'')," said he; therefore water (''udaká'') is [so] called.
3.13.5 The waters [are] excellent; the waters verily were ghee; these waters verily bear Agni-and-Soma; may the strong (''tīvrá'') satisfying savor (''rása'') of the honey-mixed (''-pṛc'') come to me along with breath, with splendor.
3.13.6 Then indeed I see, or also hear; unto me comes the noise, to me the voice of them; I think myself then to have partaken ambrosia (''amṛ́ta'') when, ye gold-colored ones, I have enjoyed (''tṛp'') you.
3.13.7 This, O waters, [is] your heart, this your young (''vatsá''), ye righteous ones; come thus hither, ye mighty ones, where I now make you enter.
;;; 14 A blessing on the kine.
3.14.1 With a comfortable (''suṣád'') stall, with wealth, with well-being, with that which is the name of the day-born one, do we unite you.
3.14.2 Let Aryaman unite you, let Pūshan, let Brihaspati, let Indra, who is conqueror of riches; in my possession gain ye what is good.
3.14.3 Having come together, iinaffrighted, rich in manure, in this stall, bearing the sweet of soma, come ye hither, free from disease.
3.14.4 Come ye just here, O kine, and flourish here like ''çákā;'' also multiply (''pra-jā'') just here; let your complaisance be toward me.
3.14.5 Let your stall be propitious; flourish ye like ''çāriçā́kā;'' also multiply just here; with me we unite you.
3.14.6 Attach yourselves, O kine, to me as lord of kine; this your stall here [be] flourishing; to you, becoming numerous with abundance of wealth, to you living, may we living be near (''upa-sad'').
;;; 15 For success in trade.
3.15.1 I stir up (''cud'') the trader Indra; let him come to us, be our forerunner; thrusting [away] the niggard, the waylaying wild animal, let him, having the power (''īç''), be giver of riches to me.
3.15.2 The many roads, travelled by the gods, that go about (''sam-car'') between heaven-and-earth - let them enjoy me with milk, with ghee, that dealing (''krī'') I may get (''ā-hṛ'') riches.
3.15.3 With fuel, O Agni, with ghee, I, desiring, offer the oblation, in order to energy (''táras''), to strength; - revering with worship (''bráhman''), so far as I am able - this divine prayer (''dhī́''), in order to hundred-fold winning.
3.15.4 This offense (? ''çaráṇi'') of ours mayest thou, O Agni, bear with (''mṛṣ''), what distant road we have gone. Successful (''çuná'') for us be bargain and sale; let return-dealing make me fruitful; do ye two enjoy this oblation in concord; successful for us be our going about and rising.
3.15.5 With what riches I practise (''car'') bargaining, seeking riches with riches, ye gods - let that become more for me, not less; O Agni, put down (''ni-sidh'') with the oblation the gain-slaying gods.
3.15.6 With what riches I practise bargaining, seeking riches with riches, ye gods - therein let Indra assign me pleasure (? ''rúci''), let Prajāpati, Savitar, Soma, Agni.
3.15.7 Unto thee with homage do we, O priest Vāiçvānara ('for all men'), give praise; do thou watch over our progeny, our selves, our kine, our breaths.
3.15.8 Every day may we bring constantly for thee as for a standing horse, O Jātavedas; rejoicing together with abundance of wealth, with food, may we thy neighbors, O Agni, take no harm.
;;; 16 Morning invocation to various gods, especially Bhaga.
3.16.1 Early (''prātár'') do we call Agni, early Indra, early Mitra-and-Varuṇa, early the (two) Açvins, early Bhaga, Pūshan, Brahmaṇaspati, early Soma and Rudra do we call.
3.16.2 The early-conquering formidable Bhaga do we call, the son of Aditi who is disposer (''vidhartár''), to whom every one that thinks himself weak [or] strong, to whom even the king says: "apportion [me] a portion."
3.16.3 O Bhaga, conductor, Bhaga, thou of true bestowal, Bhaga, help upward this prayer (''dhī́''), giving to us; O Bhaga, cause us to multiply with kine, with horses, O Bhaga, with men, - rich in men may we be.
3.16.4 Both now may we be fortunate (''bhágavant''), and in the advance (? ''prapitvá'') and in the middle of the days; and, O bounteous one, at the up-going of the sun, may we be in the favor of the gods.
3.16.5 Let the god Bhaga himself be fortunate; through him may we be fortunate; on thee here, Bhaga, do I call entire; do thou, O Bhaga, be our forerunner here.
3.16.6 The dawns submit themselves (? ''sam-nam'') to the sacrifice (''adhvará''), as Dadhikrāvan to the bright place; hitherward let them convey for me Bhaga, acquirer of good things, as vigorous (''vājín'') horses a chariot.
3.16.7 Let excellent dawns, rich in horses, rich in kine, rich in heroes, always shine for us, yielding (''duh'') ghee, on all sides drunk of: do ye protect us ever with well-beings.

3.17.1 The poets (''kaví'') harness the plows (''sī́ra''), they extend severally the yokes - they the wise ones (''dhī́ra''), with desire of favor (?) toward the gods.
3.17.2 Harness ye the plows, extend the yokes; scatter (''vap'') the seed here in the prepared womb; may the bunch (?) of ''virā́j'' be burdened for us; may the sickles draw in (''ā-yu'') the ripe [grain] yet closer.
3.17.3 Let the plow (''lā́n̄gala''), lance-pointed, well-lying, with well-smoothed handle, turn up (''ud-vap'') cow, sheep, an on-going chariot-frame, and a plump wench.
3.17.4 Let Indra hold down the furrow; let Pūshan defend it; let it, rich in milk, yield to us each further summer.
3.17.5 Successfully (''çunám'') let the good plowshares thrust apart the earth; successfully let the plowmen follow the beasts of draft; O Çunāsīrā, do ye (two), dripping (?) with oblation, make the herbs rich in berries for this man.

3.17.7 O Çunāsīrā, do ye (two) enjoy me here; what milk ye have made in heaven, therewith pour ye upon this [furrow].
3.17.8 O furrow, we reverence thee; be [turned] hitherward, O fortunate one, that thou mayest be well-willing to us, that thou mayest become of good fruit for us.
3.17.9 With ghee, with honey (''mádhu'') [is] the furrow all anointed, approved (''anu-man'') by all the gods, by the Maruts; do thou, O furrow, turn hither unto us with milk, rich in refreshment, swelling with fulness of ghee.
;;; 18 Against a rival wife: with a plant.
3.18.1 I dig this herb, of plants the strongest, with which one drives off (''bādh'') her rival; with which one wins completely (''sam-vid'') her husband.
3.18.2 O thou of outstretched leaves, fortunate, god-quickened, powerful, do thou thrust away my rival, make my husband wholly mine.
3.18.3 Since he has not named (''grah'') thy name, thou also stayest (''ram'') not with him as husband; unto distant distance make we my rival go.
3.18.4 Superior [am] I, O superior one; superior, indeed, to them (f.) that are superior; below [is] she that is my rival; lower [is] she than they (f.) that are lower.
3.18.5 I am overpowering; likewise art thou very powerful; we both, becoming full of power, will overpower my rival.
3.18.6 I have put on (''abhí'') for thee the overpowering one (f.); I have put to (''úpa'') for thee the very powerful one; after me let thy mind run forth as a cow after her calf, run as water on its track.

3.19.3 Downward let them fall, let them become inferior, who shall fight against (''pṛtany-'') our bounteous patron (''sūrí''); I destroy the enemies by my incantation; I lead up our own men.
3.19.4 Sharper than an ax, also sharper than fire, sharper than Indra's thunderbolt - [they] of whom I am the household priest.
3.19.5 The weapons of them I sharpen up; their royalty having good heroes, I increase; be their authority unwasting, victorious; their intent let all the gods aid.
3.19.6 Let their energies (''vā́jina'') be excited, O bounteous one (''maghávan''); let the noise of the conquering heroes arise; let the noises, the clear (''ketumánt'') halloos, go up severally; let the divine Maruts, with Indra as their chief, go with the army.
3.19.7 Go forth, conquer, O men; formidable be your arms (''bāhú''); having sharp arrows, slay them of weak bows; having formidable weapons, having formidable arms (''bāhú''), [slay] the weak ones.

3.20.6 Indra-and-Vāyu, both of them here, we call here with good call, that to us even every man may be well-willing in intercourse, and may become desirous of giving to us.
3.20.7 Do thou stir up Aryaman, Brihaspati, Indra, unto giving; [also] Vāta (wind), Vishṇu, Sarasvatī, and the vigorous (''vājín'') Savitar.
3.20.8 In the impulse (''prasavá'') of vigor (? ''vā́ja'') now have we come into being, and all these beings within. Both let him, foreknowing, cause him to give who is unwilling to give, and do thou confirm to us wealth having all heroes.

3.22.2 Let both Mitra and Varuṇa, Indra and Rudra, [each] take notice; the all-nourishing gods - let them anoint me with splendor.
3.22.3 With what splendor the elephant came into being, with what the king among men (''manuṣyà''), among waters, with what the gods in the beginning went to godhood - with that splendor do thou, O Agni, now make me splendid.
3.22.4 What great splendor becomes thine, O Jātavedas, from the offering; how great splendor there is of the sun, and of the ''ásura''-like elephant - so great splendor let the (two) Açvins, lotus-wreathed, assign unto me.
3.22.5 As far as the four directions, as far as the eye reaches (''sam-aç''), let so great force (''indriyá'') come together, that elephant-splendor, in me.

3.23.3 Give birth to a male, a son; after him let a male be born; mayest thou be mother of sons, of those born and whom thou shalt bear.
3.23.4 And what excellent seeds the bulls generate, with them do thou acquire (''vid'') a son; become thou a productive milch-cow.
3.23.5 I perform for thee the [ceremony] of Prajāpati; let a fœtus come to thy womb; acquire thou a son, O woman, who shall be weal for thee; weal also for him do thou become.

3.24.5 O hundred-handed one, bring together; O thousand-handed one, pile together; of what is made and of what is to be made do thou convey together the fatness here.

;;; 28 To avert the ill omen of a twinning animal.
3.28.1 She herself came into being by a one-by-one creation, where the being-makers created the kine of all forms; where the twinning [cow] gives birth, out of season, she destroys the cattle, snarling, angry.
3.28.2 She quite destroys the cattle, becoming a flesh-eater, devourer (? ''vy-ádvarī''); also one should give her to a priest (''brahmán''); so would she be pleasant, propitious.

3.29.2 All desires (''kā́ma'') it fulfils, arising (''ā-bhū''), coming forth (''pra-bhū''), becoming (''bhū''); [as] fulfiller of designs, the white-footed sheep, being given, is not exhausted (''upa-das'').

3.30.2 Be the son submissive to the father, like-minded with the mother; let the wife to the husband speak words (''vā́c'') full of honey, wealful.

3.30.6 Your drinking (''prapā́'') [be] the same, in common your share of food; in the same harness (''yóktra'') do I join ''yuj'' you together; worship ye Agni united, like spokes about a nave.
3.30.7 United, like-minded I make you, of one bunch, all of you, by [my] conciliation; [be] like the gods defending immortality (''amṛ́ta''); late and early be well-willing yours.
;;; 31 For welfare and long life.

3.31.5 Tvashṭar harnesses (''yuj'') for his daughter a wedding-car (''vahatú''); at the news, all this creation (''bhúvana'') goes away; I away from all evil [have turned], away from ''yákṣma'', to union (''sám'') with life-time.
3.31.6 Agni puts together the breaths; the moon is put together with breath: I away from all evil [have turned], away from ''yákṣma'', to union (''sám'') with life-time.

3.31.8 By the breath of the long-lived, of the life-makers (''āyuṣkṛ́t''), do thou live; do not die: I away from all evil [have turned], away from ''yákṣma'', to union (''sám'') with life-time.

3.31.11 Hither with Parjanya's rain have we stood up immortal: I away from all evil [have turned], away from ''yákṣma'', to union (''sám'') with life-time.
;;; 1 Mystic.
4.1.1 The ''bráhman'' that was first born of old (''purástāt;'' in the east?) Vena hath unclosed from the well-shining edge (''sīmatás;'' horizon?); he unclosed the fundamental nearest shapes (''viṣṭhā́'') of it, the womb (''yóni'') of the existent and of the non-existent.
4.1.2 Let this queen of the Fathers (? ''pítrya'') go in the beginning (''ágre'') for the first birth (''janús;'' race?), standing in the creation; for it (him?) have I sent (''hi'') this well-shining sinuous one (? ''hvārá''); let them mix (''çrī;'' boil?) the hot drink for the first thirsty one (? ''dhāsyú'').
4.1.3 He who was born forth the knowing relative of it speaks all the births (''jániman'') of the gods; he bore up the ''bráhman'' from the midst of the ''bráhman;'' downward, upward, he set forth unto the ''svadhā́s''.
4.1.4 For he of the heaven, he of the earth the right-stander, fixed (''skabh'') [as his] abode (''kṣéma'') the (two) great firmaments (''ródasī'') the great one, when born, fixed apart the (two) great ones, the heaven [as] seat (''sádman'') and the earthly space (''rájas'').
4.1.5 He from the fundamental birth (''janús'') hath attained (''aç'') unto (''abhi'') the summit; Brihaspati, the universal ruler, [is] the divinity of him; since the bright (''çukrá'') day was born of light, then let the shining (''dyumánt'') seers (''vípra'') fade out (? ''vi-vas'') shine out?.
4.1.6 Verily doth the ''kāvyá'' further (''hi'') that of him - the abode (? ''dhā́man'') of the great god of old (''pūrvyá''); he was born together with many thus, sleeping now in the loosened (''vi-si'') eastern half.
4.1.7 Whoso shall approach (? ''ava-gam'') with homage father Atharvan, relative of the gods, Brihaspati - in order that thou mayest be generator of all, poet, god, not to be harmed, self-ruling (? ''svadhā́vant'').
;;; 2 To the unknown god.
4.2.1 He who is soul-giving, strength-giving; of whom all, of whom [even] the gods, wait upon the instruction; who is lord (''īç'') of these bipeds, who of quadrupeds - to what god may we pay worship (''vidh'') with oblation?

4.2.7 The golden embryo was evolved (''sam-vṛt'') in the beginning; it was, when born, the sole lord of existence (''bhūtá''); it maintained earth and heaven - to what god may we pay worship with oblation?
4.2.8 The waters, generating a young (''vatsá''), set in motion (''sam-īray'') in the beginning an embryo; and of that, when born, the fœtal envelop (''úlba'') was of gold - to what god may we pay worship with oblation?
;;; 3 Against wild beasts and thieves.
4.3.1 Up from here have stridden three - tiger, man (''púruṣa''), wolf; since hey! go the rivers, hey! the divine forest-tree, hey! let the foes bow.
4.3.2 By a distant (''pára'') road let the wolf go, by a most distant also the thief; by a distant one the toothed rope, by a distant one let the malignant hasten (''ṛṣ'').
4.3.3 Both thy (two) eyes and thy mouth, O tiger, we grind up; then all thy twenty claws (''nakhá'').
4.3.4 The tiger first of [creatures] with teeth do we grind up, upon that also the thief, then the snake, the sorcerer, then the wolf.
4.3.5 What thief shall come today, he shall go away smashed; let him go by the falling-off (''apadhvaṅsá'') of roads; let Indra smite him with the thunderbolt.
4.3.6 Ruined (''mūrṇá'') [are] the teeth of the beast (''mṛgá''); crushed in also [are its] ribs; disappearing be for thee the ''godhā́;'' downward go (''ayat'') the lurking (? ''çaçayú'') beast.
4.3.7 What thou contractest (''sam-yam'') mayest thou not protract (''vi-yam''); mayest thou protract what thou dost not contract; Indra-born, soma-born art thou, an Atharvan tiger-crusher (''-jámbhana'').
;;; 4 For recovery of virility: with a plant.
4.4.1 Thee that the Gandharva dug for Varuṇa whose virility (? ''-bhráj'') was dead, thee here do we dig, a penis-erecting herb.
4.4.2 Up, the dawn; up, too, the sun; up, these words (''vácas'') of mine; up be Prajāpati stirring, the bull, with vigorous (''vājín'') energy (''çúṣma'').
4.4.3 As forsooth of thee growing up (? ''vi-ruh'') it breathes as if heated (? ''abhi-tap'') - more full of energy than that let this herb make for thee.
4.4.4 Up, the energies (''çúṣma'') of herbs, the essences (''sā́ra'') of bulls; the virility (''vṛ́ṣṇya'') of men (''púṁs'') do thou put together in him, O Indra, self-controller.
4.4.5 Of the waters the first-born sap, likewise of the forest-trees; also Soma's brother art thou; also virility art thou of the stag.
4.4.6 Now, Agni! now, Savitar! now, goddess Sarasvatī! now, Brahmaṇaspati, make his member taut like a bow.
4.4.7 I make thy member taut, like a bowstring on a bow; mount (''kram''), as it were a stag a doe, unrelaxingly always (?).
4.4.8 Of the horse, of the mule, of the he-goat and of the ram, also of the bull what vigors there are - them do thou put in him, O self-controller.
;;; 5 An incantation to put to sleep.
4.5.1 The thousand-horned bull that came up from the ocean - with him, the powerful one, do we put the people to sleep.
4.5.2 The wind bloweth not over the earth; no one soever seeth over [it]; both all the women and the dogs do thou make to sleep, going with Indra as companion.
4.5.3 The women that are lying on a bench, lying on a couch, lying in a litter; the women that are of pure odor - all of them we make to sleep.
4.5.4 Whatever stirs have I seized; eye, breath have I seized; all the limbs have I seized, in the depth (''atiçarvará'') of the nights.
4.5.5 Whoso sits, whoso goes about, and whoso standing looks out - of them we put together the eyes, just like this habitation (''harmyá'').
4.5.6 Let the mother sleep, the father sleep, the dog sleep, the housemaster (''viçpáti'') sleep; let the relatives (''jñātí'') of her sleep; let this folk round about sleep.
4.5.7 O sleep, with the imposition (''abhikaraṇa'') of sleep do thou put to. sleep all the folk; till sun-up make the others sleep, till dawning let me be awake, like Indra, uninjured, unexhausted.
;;; 6 Against the poison of a poisoned arrow.
4.6.1 The Brahman was born first, with ten heads, with ten mouths; he first drank the soma; he made the poison sapless.
4.6.2 As great as [are] heaven-and-earth by their width, as much as the seven rivers spread out (''vi-sthā''), [so far] have I spoken out from here these words (''vā́c''), spoilers of poison.
4.6.3 The winged (''garutmant'') eagle consumed (''av'') thee first, O poison; thou hast not intoxicated (''mad''), thou hast not racked (''rup'') [him]; and thou becamest drink for him.
4.6.4 He of five fingers that hurled at thee from some crooked bow - from the tip (''çalyá'') of the ''apaskambhá'' have I exorcised (''nir-vac'') the poison.
4.6.5 From the tip have I exorcised the poison, from the anointing and from the feather-socket; from the barb (''apāṣṭhá''), the horn, the neck have I exorcised the poison.
4.6.6 Sapless, O arrow, is thy tip; likewise thy poison is sapless; also thy bow, of a sapless tree, O sapless one, is sapless.
4.6.7 They who mashed, who smeared, who hurled, who let loose - they [are] all made impotent; impotent is made the poison-mountain.
4.6.8 Impotent [are] thy diggers; impotent art thou, O herb; impotent [is] that rugged (''párvata'') mountain whence was born this poison.
;;; 7 Against poison.
4.7.1 This water (''vā́r'') shall ward off (''vāray-'') upon the Varaṇāvatī; an on-pouring of ambrosia (''amṛ́ta'') is there; with it I ward off thy poison.
4.7.2 Sapless is the poison of the east, sapless what is of the north; also this that is of the south is exchangeable with gruel (''karambhá'').
4.7.3 Having made gruel of sesame (?), teeming with fat, steaming (?), thou dost not rack, O ill-bodied one, him that has eaten thee merely from hunger.
4.7.4 Away we make thine intoxication fly, like an arrow (''çará''), O intoxicating one (f.); we make thee with our spell (''vácas'') to stand forth, like a boiling pot.
4.7.5 With a spell we cause to stand about [thee] as it were a collected troop (''grā́ma''); stand thou, like a tree in [its] station; spade-dug one (f.), thou rackest not.
4.7.6 For covers (? ''pavásta'') they bought thee, also for garments (? ''dūrçá''), for goat-skins; purchasable (? ''prakrī́'') art thou, O herb; spade-dug one, thou rackest not.
4.7.7 Who of you did what first unattained deeds - let them not harm our heroes here; for that purpose I put you forward.
;;; 8 Accompanying the consecration of a king.
4.8.1 The being (''bhūtá'') sets milk in beings; he has become the overlord of beings; Death attends (''car'') the royal consecration (''rājasū́ya'') of him; let him, as king, approve this royalty.
4.8.2 Go forward unto [it]; do not long (? ''ven'') away, a stern (''ugrá'') corrector (''cettár''), rival-slayer; approach (''ā-sthā''), O increaser of friends; may the gods bless (''adhi-brū'') thee.
4.8.3 Him approaching all waited upon (''pari-bhūṣ''); clothing himself in fortune, he goes about (''car''), having own brightness; great is that name of the virile (''vṛ́ṣan'') Asura; having all forms, he approached immortal things.
4.8.4 A tiger, upon the tiger's [skin], do thou stride out unto the great quarters; let all the people (''víças'') want thee, the waters of heaven, rich in milk.
4.8.5 The waters of heaven that revel with milk, in the atmosphere or also on the earth - with the splendor of all those waters do I pour upon (''abhi-sic'') thee.
4.8.6 The heavenly waters, rich in milk, have poured upon thee with splendor; that thou be an increaser of friends, so shall Savitar make thee.
4.8.7 Thus, embracing the tiger, they incite (''hi'') the lion unto great good-fortune; as the well-being ones (''subhū́'') the ocean that stands, do they rub thoroughly down the leopard amid the waters.
;;; 9 For protection etc.: with a certain ointment.
4.9.1 Come thou, rescuing the living one; of the mountain art thou for the eyes (?), given by all the gods, an enclosure (''paridhí'') in order to living.
4.9.2 Protection (''paripā́ṇa'') of men (''púruṣa''), protection of kine art thou; in order to the protection of coursing (''árvant'') horses hast thou stood.
4.9.3 Both art thou a protection, grinder-up of familiar demons (''yātú''), O ointment, and of what is immortal thou knowest; likewise art thou gratification (''-bhójana'') of the living, likewise remedy of jaundice (''hárita-'').
4.9.4 Of whomsoever, O ointment, thou creepest over limb after limb, joint after joint, from thence thou drivest away the ''yákṣma'', like a formidable mid-lier (''madhyamaçī́'').
4.9.5 Curse attains him not, nor witchcraft, nor scorching; ''víṣkandha'' reaches him not who beareth thee, O ointment.
4.9.6 From wrong spell, from evil dreaming, from evil deed, from pollution also, from the terrible eye of an enemy - therefrom protect us, ointment.
4.9.7 Knowing this, O ointment, I shall speak truth, not falsehood; may I win (''san'') a horse, a cow, thy soul, O man (''púruṣa'').
4.9.8 Three are the slaves (''dāsá'') of the ointment - fever (''takmán''), ''balā́sa'', then snake: the highest of mountains, three-peaked (''trikakúd'') by name, [is] thy father.
4.9.9 The ointment that is of the three-peaked [mountain], born from the snowy one (''himávant'') - may it grind up all the familiar demons and all the sorceresses.
4.9.10 If thou art of the three-peaked [mountain], or if thou art called of the Yamunā - both thy names are excellent; by them protect us, O ointment.
;;; 10 Against evils: with a pearl-shell amulet.
4.10.1 Born from the wind out of the atmosphere, out from the light of lightning, let this gold-born shell, of pearl, protect us from distress.
4.10.2 Thou that wast born from the top of the shining spaces (''rocaná''), out of the ocean - by the shell having slain the demons, we overpower the devourers.
4.10.3 By the shell [we overpower] disease, misery; by the shell also the ''sadā́nvās;'' let the all-healing shell, of pearl, protect us from distress.
4.10.4 Born in the sky, ocean-born, brought hither out of the river, this gold-born shell [is] for us a life-prolonging amulet.
4.10.5 The amulet born from the ocean, born from Vṛtra, making day - let it protect us on all sides from the missile of gods and Asuras.
4.10.6 One of the golds art thou; out of soma wast thou born; thou art conspicuous on the chariot, lustrous (''rocaná'') on the quiver thou. May it prolong our lives!
4.10.7 The gods' bone became pearl; that goes about within the waters, possessing soul; that do I bind on thee in order to life-time, splendor, strength, to length of life for a hundred autumns: let [the amulet] of pearl defend thee.
;;; 11 In praise of the draft-ox.
4.11.1 The draft-ox sustains earth and sky; the draft-ox sustains the wide atmosphere; the draft-ox sustains the six wide directions; the draft-ox hath entered into all existence.
4.11.2 The draft-ox [is] Indra; he looks out from (for?) the cattle; triple ways the mighty one (''çakrá'') measures out (traverses?); yielding (''duh'') the past (? ''bhūtá''), the future, existing things (''bhúvana''), he goes upon (''car'') all the courses (''vratá'') of the gods.
4.11.3 Born an Indra among human beings (''manuṣyà''), he goes about (''car'') shining brightly, a heated hot-drink (''gharmá''); he, being one of good offspring, shall not go in mist (? ''udārá'') who, understanding [it], shall not partake of (''aç'') the draft-ox.
4.11.4 The draft-ox yields milk (''duh'') in the world of the well-done; the purifying one fills him up from in front; Parjanya [is] his streams, the Maruts his udder, the sacrifice his milk, the sacrificial gift the milking of him.
4.11.5 Of whom the lord of the sacrifice is not master (''īç''), nor the sacrifice; not the giver is master of him, nor the acceptor; who is all-conquering, all-bearing, all-working - tell ye us the hot-drink which [is] four-footed.
4.11.6 By whom the gods ascended to heaven (''svàr''), quitting the body, to the navel of the immortal, by him may we go to the world of the well-done, desiring glory, by the vow (''vratá'') of the hot-drink, by penance.
4.11.7 Indra by form, Agni by carrying (''váha''), Prajāpati, Parameshṭhin, Virāj; in Viçvānara he strode, in Vāiçvānara he strode, in the draft-ox he strode; he made firm, he sustained.
4.11.8 That is the middle of the draft-ox, where this carrying (''váha'') is set; so much of him is in front (''prācī́na'') as he is put all together on the opposite side.
4.11.9 Whoso knows the milkings of the draft-ox, seven, unfailing, both progeny and world he obtains: so the seven seers know.
4.11.10 With his feet treading down debility (''sedí''), with his thighs (''ján̄ghā'') extracting (''ut-khid'') refreshing drink - with weariness go the draft-ox and the plowman unto sweet drink (''kīlála'').
4.11.11 Twelve, indeed, they declare those nights of the vow (''vrátya'') of Prajāpati; whoso knows the ''bráhman'' within them (''tátro ’pa'') - that verily is the vow of the draft-ox.
4.11.12 He milks (''duh'') at evening, he milks in the morning, he milks about midday; the milkings of him that come together, those unfailing ones we know.
;;; 12 To heal serious wounds: with an herb.
4.12.1 Grower art thou, grower; grower of severed bone; make this grow, O ''arundhatī́''.
4.12.2 What of thee is torn (''riç''), what of thee is inflamed (? ''dyut''), is crushed (? ''péṣṭra'') in thyself - may Dhātar excellently put that together again, joint with joint.
4.12.3 Let thy marrow come together with marrow, and thy joint together with joint; together let what of thy flesh has fallen apart, together let thy bone grow over.
4.12.4 Let marrow be put together with marrow; let skin (''cárman'') grow (''ruh'') with skin; let thy blood, bone grow; let flesh grow with flesh.
4.12.5 Fit thou together hair with hair; fit together skin (''tvác'') with skin; let thy blood, bone grow; put together what is severed, O herb.
4.12.6 Do thou here stand up, go forth, run forth, a chariot well-wheeled, well-tired, well-naved; stand firm upright.
4.12.7 If, falling into a pit, he hath been crushed (''sam-çṛ''), or if a stone hurled (''pra-kṛ'') hath smitten [him] - as a Ṛbhu the parts of a chariot, may it put together joint with joint.
;;; 13 For healing.
4.13.1 Both, O ye gods, him that is put down, O ye gods, ye lead up again, and him that hath done evil (''ā́gas''), O ye gods, O ye gods, ye make to live again.
4.13.2 These two winds blow from the river as far as the distance; let the one blow hither dexterity for thee; let the other blow away what complaint (''rápas'') [thou hast].
4.13.3 Hither, O wind, blow healing; away, O wind, blow what complaint [there is]; for thou, all-healing one, goest [as] messenger of the gods.
4.13.4 Let the gods rescue this man, let the troops of Maruts rescue, let all beings rescue, that this man may be free from complaints.
4.13.5 I have come unto thee with wealfulnesses, likewise with uninjurednesses; I have brought for thee formidable dexterity; I drive (''sū'') away for thee the ''yákṣma''.
4.13.6 This is my fortunate hand, this my more fortunate one, this my all-healing one; this is of propitious touch.
4.13.7 With (two) ten-branched hands - the tongue [is] forerunner of voice - with (two) disease-removing hands: with them do we touch thee.
;;; 14 With the sacrifice of a goat.
4.14.1 Since the goat has been born from the heat of Agni (the fire), it saw [its] generator in the beginning; by it the gods in the beginnings attained (''i'') [their] godhead; by (with?) it the sacrificial ones (''médhya'') ascended the ascents (''róha'').
4.14.2 Stride ye with the fire to the firmament (''nā́ka''), bearing in your hands vessel-[fires] (''úkhya''); having gone to the back of the sky, to the heaven (''svàr''), sit ye mingled with the gods.
4.14.3 From the back of earth I have ascended to the atmosphere; from the atmosphere I have ascended to the sky; from the back of the sky, of the firmament (''nā́ka''), I have gone to heaven (''svàr''), to light.
4.14.4 Going to heaven (''svàr'') they look not away; they ascend to the sky, the two firmaments (''ródasī'') - they who, well-knowing, have extended the everywhere-streaming sacrifice.
4.14.5 O Agni, go forth first of the divinities, eye of gods and of human beings (''mā́nuṣa'') - pressing on (? ''íyakṣa-'') in unison with the Bhṛgus, let the sacrificers go to heaven (''svàr''), to well-being.
4.14.6 With milk, with ghee, I anoint the goat, the heavenly eagle, milky, great; by it may we go to the world of the well-done, ascending the heaven (''svàr''), unto the highest firmament (''nā́ka'').
4.14.7 Accompanied by five rice-messes (''-odaná''), by the five fingers, with the spoon, take thou up five-fold that rice-mess. In the eastern quarter set thou the head of the goat; in the southern (''dákṣiṇa'') quarter set his right (''dákṣiṇa'') side.
4.14.8 In the western quarter set his rump (''bhasád''); in the northern (''úttara'') quarter set his other (''úttara'') side; in the upward quarter set the goat's back-bone; in the fixed quarter set his belly (? ''pājasyà''); midway in the atmosphere his middle.
4.14.9 Do thou envelop with cooked skin the cooked goat, brought together with all his limbs, all-formed. Do thou rise up from here unto the highest firmament (''nā́ka''); with thy four feet stand firm in the quarters.
;;; 15 For abundant rain.
4.15.1 Let the directions, full of mist (''nábhasvant''), fly up together; let clouds, wind-hurried, come together; let the lowing [cows] of the resounding misty great bull, the waters, gratify the earth.
4.15.2 Let the mighty (''taviṣá''), liberal (''sudā́nu'') ones cause to behold together; let the juices (''rása'') of the waters attach themselves (''sac'') to the herbs; let gushes (''sárga'') of rain gladden (''mahay-'') the earth; let herbs of all forms be born here and there (''pṛ́thak'').
4.15.3 Do thou make the singers (''gā́yant'') to behold together the mists; let rushes (''véga'') of waters rush (''vij'') up here and there; let gushes of rain gladden the earth; let plants of all forms be born here and there.
4.15.4 Let the troops of Maruts sing unto thee, O Parjanya, noisy here and there; let gushes of raining rain rain along the earth.
4.15.5 Send up, O Maruts, from the ocean; brilliant [is] the song; ye make the mist fly up; let the lowing [cows] of the resounding misty great bull, the waters, gratify the earth.
4.15.6 Roar on, thunder, excite (''ard'') the water-holder; anoint the earth, O Parjanya, with milk; by thee poured out, let abundant rain come; let him of lean kine, seeking refuge, go home.
4.15.7 Let the liberal ones favor (''sam-av'') you, also the fountains, great serpents (''ajagará''); let the clouds, started forward by the Maruts, rain along the earth.
4.15.8 Let it lighten to every region (''ā́çā''); let the winds blow to (from ?) every quarter; let the clouds, started forward by the Maruts, come together along the earth.
4.15.9 Waters, lightning, cloud, rain - let the liberal ones favor you, also the fountains, great serpents; let the clouds, started forward by the Maruts, show favor (''pra-av'') along the earth.
4.15.10 Agni, who, in unison with the waters' selves (''tanū́''), hath become overlord of the herbs - let him, Jātavedas, win (''van'') for us rain, breath for [our] progeny, ''amṛ́ta'' out of the sky.
4.15.11 May Prajāpati from the sea, the ocean, sending waters, excite the water-holder; let the seed of the stallion (''vṛ́ṣan áçva'') be filled up; come hitherward with that thunder, -
4.15.12 Pouring down waters, our Asura father. Let the gurgles of the waters puff, O Varuṇa; let down the descending waters; let the speckled-armed frogs croak (''vad'') along the water-courses (''íriṇa'').
4.15.13 Having lain for a year, [like] Brahmans performing a vow, the frogs have spoken forth a voice quickened by Parjanya.
4.15.14 Speak forth unto [it], O she-frog; speak to the rain, O ''tādurī;'' swim in the midst of the pool, spreading thy four feet.
4.15.15 O ''khaṇvakhā!'' O ''khāimakhā!'' in the middle, O ''tadurī!'' win ye rain, O Fathers; seek the favor (''mánas'') of the Maruts.
4.15.16 The great vessel (''kóça'') do thou draw up (''ud-ac''); pour on; let there be lightnings; let the wind blow; let them extend the sacrifice, being manifoldly let loose; let the herbs become full of delight.
;;; 16 The power of the gods.
4.16.1 The great superintendent of them sees, as it were, from close by; whoever thinks to be going on in secret, all this the gods know.
4.16.2 Whoso stands, goes about, and whoso goes crookedly (''vañc''), whoso goes about hiddenly, who defiantly (? ''pratán̄kam'') - what two, sitting down together, talk, king Varuṇa, as third, knows that.
4.16.3 Both this earth is king Varuṇa's, and yonder great sky with distant margins (''-ánta''); also the two oceans are Varuṇa's paunches; also in this petty water is he hidden.
4.16.4 Also whoso should creep far off beyond the sky, he should not be released from king Varuṇa; from the sky his spies go forth hither; thousand-eyed, they look over the earth.
4.16.5 All this king Varuna beholds (''vi-cakṣ'') - what is between the two firmaments (''ródasī''), what beyond; numbered of him are the winkings of people; as a gambler the dice, [so] does he fix (? ''ni-mi'') these things.
4.16.6 What fetters (''pā́ça'') of thine, O Varuṇa, seven by seven, stand triply relaxed (''vi-si''), shining - let them all bind him that speaks untruth; whoso is truth-speaking, let them let him go.
4.16.7 With a hundred fetters, O Varuṇa, do thou bridle (''abhi-dhā'') him; let not the speaker of untruth escape thee, O men-watcher; let the villain sit letting his belly fall [apart], like a hoopless vessel, being cut round about.
4.16.8 The Varuṇa that is lengthwise (''samāmyà''), that is crosswise (''vyāmyà''); the Varuṇa that is of the same region (''saṁdeçyà''), that is of a different region (''videçyà''); the Varuṇa that is of the gods, and that is of men -
4.16.9 With all those fetters I fasten (''abhi-sā'') thee, O so-and-so, of such-and-such a family, son of such-and-such a mother; and all of them I successively appoint for thee.
;;; 17 Against various evils: with a plant.
4.17.1 Thee, the mistress of remedies, O conquering one (''ujjeṣá''), we take hold of; I have made thee a thing of thousand-fold energy (''-vīryà'') for every one, O herb.
4.17.2 The truly-conquering, the curse-repelling, the overcoming, the reverted one (''punaḥsará'') - all the herbs have I called together, saying "may they (?) save us from this."
4.17.3 She that hath cursed with cursing, that hath taken malignity as her root, that hath seized on [our] young to take [its] sap - let her eat [her own] offspring.
4.17.4 What [witchcraft] they have made for thee in the raw vessel (''pā́tra''), what they have made in the blue-red one, in raw flesh what witchcraft they have made - with that do thou smite the witchcraft-makers.
4.17.5 Evil-dreaming, evil-living, demon, monster (''abhvà''), hags, all the ill-named (f.), ill-voiced - them we make disappear from us.
4.17.6 Death by hunger, death by thirst, kinelessness, childlessness - through thee, O off-wiper (''apāmārgá''), we wipe off all that.
4.17.7 Death by thirst, death by hunger, likewise defeat at dice - through thee, O off-wiper, we wipe off all that.
4.17.8 The off-wiper is indeed of all herbs the sole controller (''vaçín''); with it we wipe [off] what has befallen (''ā́sthita'') thee; then do thou go about free from disease.
;;; 18 Against witchcraft: with a plant.
4.18.1 The same light with the sun - night possesses the same with the day; I make what is effective (''satyá'') for aid; sapless be the makers (f.) [of witchcraft].
4.18.2 Whoso, O gods, having made witchcraft, shall take it to the house of one unknowing - let it, like a sucking (''dhārú'') calf to its mother, go back unto him.
4.18.3 Whoso, having made evil at home, desires to slay another with it - numerous stones make a loud crash when it (f.) is burned.
4.18.4 O thou of a thousand abodes (? ''-dhā́man''), do thou make them lie (?) crestless, neckless; take back the witchcraft to him that made it, like a sweet-heart (''priyā́'') to a lover (''priyā́vant'').
4.18.5 I, with this herb, have spoiled all witchcrafts - what one they have made in the field, what in the kine, or what in thy men (''púruṣa'').
4.18.6 He who hath made hath not been able to make; he hath crushed (''çṛ'') a foot, a finger; he hath made what is excellent for us, but for himself a burning (''tápana'').
4.18.7 Let the off-wiper wipe off the ''kṣetriyá'' and whatever curse [there is]; [wipe] off, forsooth, the sorceresses, off all the hags.
4.18.8 Having wiped off the sorcerers, off all the hags, O off-wiper, with thee do we wipe off all that.
;;; 19 Against enemies: with a plant.
4.19.1 Both art thou not relative-making, and now art thou kin-making; also do thou cut off (? ''ā-chid'') the progeny of the witchcraft-maker, like a reed of the rainy season (''vā́rṣika'').
4.19.2 Thou art bespoken (?) by a Brāhman, by Kaṇva son of Nṛshad; thou goest like a brilliant army (?); there is no fear (''bhayá'') there where thou arrivest (''pra-āp''), O herb.
4.19.3 Thou goest to the head (''ágra'') of the herbs, causing to shine (''dīp'') upon [us] as it were with light; also rescuer art thou of the simple (''pā́ka''), likewise slayer art thou of the demoniac.
4.19.4 When yonder, in the beginning, the gods by thee removed (''nis-kṛ'') the Asuras, from thence, O herb, wast thou born, an off-wiper.
4.19.5 Splitting apart (''vi-bhid''), hundred-branched - "splitting apart" by name is thy father; in return (''pratyák''), do thou split apart him who assails us.
4.19.6 The non-existent came into being (''sam-bhū'') from the earth; that goes to the sky, the great expanse (''vyácas''); let that, verily, fuming abroad, come back thence on the maker.
4.19.7 Since thou hast come into being reverted (''pratyáñc''), having reverted fruit, do thou repel (''yu'') from me all curses, [repel] very far the deadly weapon.
4.19.8 Protect me around with a hundred; defend me with a thousand; may the forceful (''ugrá'') Indra, O lord of the plants, assign force (''ojmán'') unto thee.
;;; 20 To discover sorcerers: with an herb.
4.20.1 He (?) looks on, he looks toward, he looks away, he looks: the sky, the atmosphere, then the earth - all that, O divine one (f.), he looks at.
4.20.2 Three skies, three earths, and these six directions severally - by thee let me see all beings, O divine herb.
4.20.3 Of that heavenly eagle art thou the eye-pupil; thou here hast ascended the earth as a wearied bride (''vadhū́'') a litter.
4.20.4 May the thousand-eyed god set it in my right hand; with it do I see every one, both who is Çūdra and [who] Āryan.
4.20.5 Make manifest [thy] forms; do not hide thyself away; then mayest thou, O thousand-eyed one, look upon the ''kimīdíns''.
4.20.6 Show me the sorcerers; show the sorceresses; show all the ''piçācás:'' with this intent I take hold of (''ā-rabh'') thee, O herb.
4.20.7 The eye of Kaçyapa art thou, and of the four-eyed bitch; conceal thou not the ''piçācá'', like the sun gliding (''sṛp'') in the clear sky (''vīdhrá'').
4.20.8 I have seized (''ud-grabh'') out of his shelter (''paripā́ṇa'') the sorcerer, the ''kimīdín;'' with it do I see every one, both Çūdra and Āryan.
4.20.9 Whichever flies through the atmosphere, and whichever creeps across the sky; whichever thinks the earth a refuge (''nāthá'') - that ''piçācá'' do thou show forth.
;;; 21 Praise of the kine.
4.21.1 The kine have come, and have done what is excellent; let them stay (''sad'') in the stall (''goṣṭhá''); let them take pleasure with us; may they be rich in progeny here, many-formed, milking for Indra many dawns.
4.21.2 To the sacrificer and singer, to the helpful one (?), Indra verily gives further, steals not what is his; increasing more and more the wealth of him, he sets the godly man (''devayú'') in an undivided domain (? ''khilyá'').
4.21.3 They shall not be lost; no thief shall harm [them]; no hostile [person] shall dare attack their track (?); with whom he both sacrifices to the gods and gives, long verily with them does the kine-lord go in company.
4.21.4 No dust-raising horseman (? ''árvan'') reaches them; not unto the slaughter-house (?) do they go; those kine of that sacrificing mortal roam over wide-going fearlessness.
4.21.5 The kine [are] Bhaga; Indra has seemed to me the kine; the kine [are] the draught of first soma; these kine - that, O people, [is] Indra; with whatever heart [and] mind I seek Indra.
4.21.6 Ye, O kine, fatten whoever is lean; the unlovely (''açrīrá'') one ye make of good aspect; ye make the house excellent, O ye of excellent voice; great is your vigor (''váyas'') called in the assemblies (''sabhā́'').
4.21.7 Rich in progeny, shining in good pasture, drinking clear waters at a good watering-place - let not the thief master you, nor the evil-plotter; let Rudra's weapon avoid you.
;;; 22 For the success and prosperity of a king.
4.22.1 Increase, O Indra, this Kshatriya for me; make thou this man sole chief of the clans (''víç''); unman (''nis-akṣ'') all his enemies; make them subject to him in the contests for preeminence.
4.22.2 Portion thou this man in village, in horses, in kine; unportion that man who is his enemy; let this king be the summit of authorities (''kṣatrá''); O Indra, make every foe subject to him.
4.22.3 Let this man be riches-lord of riches; let this king be people-lord of people; in him, O Indra, put great splendors; destitute of splendor make thou his foe.
4.22.4 For him, O heaven-and-earth, milk ye much that is pleasant (''vāmá''), like two milch kine that yield the hot-draught (''gharmá-''); may this king be dear to Indra, dear to kine, herbs, cattle.
4.22.5 I join to thee Indra who gives superiority (? ''utttarā́vant''), by whom men conquer, are not conquered; who shall make thee sole chief of people (''jána''), also uppermost of kings descended from Manu.
4.22.6 Superior [art] thou, inferior thy rivals, whosoever, O king, are thine opposing foes; sole chief, having Indra as companion, having conquered, bring thou in the enjoyments (''bhójana'') of them that play the foe.
4.22.7 Of lion-aspect, do thou devour (''ad'') all the clans (''viç''); of tiger-aspect, do thou beat down the foes; sole chief, having Indra as companion, having conquered, seize thou on (''ā-khid'') the enjoyments of them that play the foe.
;;; 23 Praise and prayer to Agni.
4.23.1 I reverence (''man-u'') first the forethoughtful (''prácetas'') Agni, him of the five peoples, whom men kindle in many places; we pray to him who hath entered (''pra-viç'') into clans after clans (''víç''): let him free us from distress.
4.23.2 As thou carriest the oblation, O Jātavedas; as, foreknowing, thou adaptest the sacrifice - so do thou convey to us favor from the gods: let him free us from distress.
4.23.3 Put to service at every course (''yā́man''), best carrier, sharer (''ā́bhaga'') at every rite, Agni I praise, demon-slayer, sacrifice-increaser, offered to with ghee: let him free us from distress.
4.23.4 The well-born Jātavedas, the mighty (''vibhú'') Agni belonging to all men (''vāiçvānará''), the carrier of oblations, we call on: let him free us from distress.
4.23.5 With whom as ally the seers made [their] strength shine out; with whom they repelled the wiles of the Asuras; with whom, Agni, Indra conquered the Paṇis - let him free us from distress.
4.23.6 By whom the gods discovered the immortal; by whom they made the herbs rich in honey; by whom the gods brought the heaven (''svàr'') - let him free us from distress.
4.23.7 In whose direction [is] whatever shines forth (''vi-ruc'') here, what is born and to be born, all of it - I praise Agni, [as a] suppliant I call loudly on [him] - let him free us from distress.
;;; 24 Praise and prayer to Indra.
4.24.1 We reverence Indra; constantly do we reverence him; these praise-hymns (''stoma'') of the Vṛtra-slayer have come unto me; he who goes to the call of the worshiper (''dāçvā́ṅs''), of the well-doer - let him free us from distress.
4.24.2 He who, having formidable arms, is repeller (? ''yayú'') of the formidable ones (f.); who battered the strength of the Dānavas; by whom are conquered the rivers, by whom the kine - let him free us from distress.
4.24.3 He who is filler of people (''carṣaṇí-''), bull, heaven-finder (''svarvíd''); for whom the pressing-stones proclaim [his] manliness; whose is the sacrifice with seven priests, most intoxicating - let him free us from distress.
4.24.4 Whose are cows (''vaçā́''), bulls, oxen; for whom, the heaven-finder, sacrificial posts (''sváru'') are set up; for whom the bright (''çukrá'') [soma] purifies itself, adorned with sacred words (''bráhma-'') - let him free us from distress.
4.24.5 He whose enjoyment (''júṣṭi'') the offerers of soma desire; whom, possessed of arrows, men call on in the cattle-raid (''gáviṣṭi''); on whom depends song (? ''arká''), on whom force - let him free us from distress.
4.24.6 He who was born first for the doing of deeds; of whom first the heroism was noted; by whom brandished (''ud-yam'') the thunderbolt went at (''abhi-i'') the dragon - let him free us from distress.
4.24.7 He who, controlling, leads together hosts (''saṁgrāmá'') for fighting; who mingles (''sam-sṛj'') the possessions (''puṣṭá'') of the two parties - I praise Indra, [as a] suppliant I call loudly on [him]: let him free us from distress.
;;; 25 Praise and prayer to Vāyu and Savitar.
4.25.1 Of Vāyu, of Savitar we reverence the counsels (''vidátha''): ye who enter and who defend what has life (''ātmanvánt''); ye who have become encompassers of the all - do ye free us from distress.
4.25.2 Of whom are numbered the widths of the earth; by whom the welkin (''rájas'') is made fast (''yup'') in the atmosphere; whose progress no one soever has reached (''anu-aç'') - do ye free us from distress.
4.25.3 In [conformity with] thy course (''vratá'') people (''jána'') go to rest; when thou art risen, they go forth, O thou of beauteous luster; ye, O Vāyu and Savitar, defend beings - do ye free us from distress.
4.25.4 Away from here, O Vāyu and Savitar, drive (''sidh'') ye what is ill-done, away the demons and Çimidā; for ye unite (''sam-sṛj'') [men] with refreshment (''ūrjā́''), with strength - do ye free us from distress.
4.25.5 Let Savitar and Vāyu engender (''ā-sū'') in my body (''tanū́'') wealth, prosperity, very propitious dexterity; do ye put here freedom from ''yákṣma'', greatness; do ye free us from distress.
4.25.6 O Savitar, Vāyu, [give] forth favor in order to aid; ye cause to revel in the intoxicating jovial [soma]; hitherward from the height (''pravát'') confirm ye of what is pleasant (''vāmá''); do ye free us from distress.
4.25.7 The best blessings (''āçís'') have come unto us in the domain (''dhā́man'') of the two gods; I praise god Savitar and Vāyu: do ye free us from distress.
;;; 26 Praise and prayer to heaven and earth.
4.26.1 I reverence you, O heaven-and-earth, ye well-nourishing ones (''subhójas''), who, like-minded (''sácetas'') did spread out unmeasured intervals (''yójana''); since ye became foundations (''pratiṣṭhā́'') of good things, do ye free us from distress.
4.26.2 Since ye became foundations of good things, ye much increased, divine, fortunate, wide-extended ones, O heaven-and-earth, be pleasant to me: do ye free us from distress.

4.27.6 If now indeed, O Maruts, by what relates to the Maruts - if, O gods, by what relates to the gods, I have fallen into such a plight: ye, O Vasus, are masters (''īç'') of the removal of that: let them free us from distress.
4.27.7 A sharp front, known [as] powerful, [is] the troop (''çárdhas'') of Maruts, formidable in fights; I praise the Maruts, [as] a suppliant I call loudly on [them]: let them free us from distress.

4.30.1 I go about with the Rudras, the Vasus, I with the Ādityas and the All-gods; I bear Mitra-and-Varuṇa both, I Indra-and-Agni, I both Açvins.
4.30.2 I am queen, gatherer of good things, the first that has understood the matters of sacrifice; me here the gods distributed manifoldly, making me of many stations enter into many.
4.30.3 I my own self say this, [which is] enjoyable of gods and of men; whomsoever I desire, him I make formidable, him priest (''brahmán''), him seer, him very wise.
4.30.4 By me doth he eat food who looks abroad, who breathes, who indeed hears what is spoken; unknowing (? ''amantú'') they dwell upon me; hear thou, heard-of one; I say to thee what is to be credited.

4.30.8 I myself blow forth like the wind, taking hold upon all beings; beyond the sky, beyond the earth here - such have I become by greatness.
;;; 31 Praise and prayer to fury (manyú).
4.31.1 In alliance (''sarátham'') with thee, O fury, battering, feeling excitement, excited, O companion of the Maruts, having keen arrows, sharpening up their weapons, let [our] men go forward unto [the foe], having forms of fire.
4.31.2 Like fire, O fury, do thou, made brilliant, overpower; invoked, O powerful one, do thou be our army-leader; having slain the foes, share out their possession (''védas''); making (''mā'') force, thrust away the scorners (''mṛ́dh'').
4.31.3 Overpower for us (?), O fury, the hostile plotter; go forward breaking, killing, slaughtering the foes; thy formidable rush (? ''pā́jas'') surely they have not impeded; thou, controlling, shalt bring them under control, O sole-born one.
4.31.4 Thou art the one praised (?) of many, O fury; sharpen up clan on clan (''víç'') unto fighting; with thee as ally (''yuj''), O thou of undivided brightness (?), we make a clear noise unto victory.
4.31.5 Victory-making, like Indra, not to be talked down, do thou, O fury, be our over-lord here; thy dear name we sing, O powerful one; we know that fount whence thou camest (''ā-bhū'').
4.31.6 Born together with efficacy (? ''ā́bhūti''), O missile (''sā́yaka'') thunderbolt, thou bearest superior power, O associate; be thou allied (''medín'') with our energy (''krátu''), O fury, much-invoked one, in the mingling (''saṁsṛ́j'') of great riches.

;;; 32 Praise and prayer to fury (manyú).
4.32.1 He who hath worshiped thee, O fury, missile thunderbolt, gains (''puṣ'') power, force, everything, in succession; may we, with thee as ally, that art made of power, overpower the barbarian, the Aryan, with powerful power.
4.32.2 Fury [was] Indra, fury indeed was a god; fury [was] priest (''hótar''), Varuṇa, Jātavedas; the clans (''víç'') which are descended from Manu (''mā́nuṣa'') praise fury; protect us, O fury, in accord with fervor (''tápas'').
4.32.3 Attack, O fury, being mightier than a mighty one; with fervor as ally smite apart the foes; slayer of enemies, slayer of Vṛtra, and slayer of barbarians, do thou bring to us all [their] good things.
4.32.4 Since thou, O fury, art of overcoming force, self-existent, terrible, overpowering hostile plotters, belonging to all men (''-carṣaṇí''), powerful, very powerful - do thou put in us force in fights.
4.32.5 Being portionless, I am gone far away, by the action (? ''krátu'') of thee that art mighty, O forethoughtful one; so at thee, O fury, I, actionless, was wrathful; come to us, thine own self (''tanū́''), giving strength.

4.37.11 One as it were a dog, one as it were an ape, a boy all hairy - having become as it were dear to see, the Gandharva fastens upon (''sac'') women; him we make disappear from here by [our] mighty (''vīryàvant'') incantation (''bráhman'').

5.6.14 Indra's guard (''várūtha'') art thou; to thee there I go forth; thee there I enter, with all my kine, with all my men, with all my soul, with all my body, with that which is mine.
;;; 7 Against niggardliness and its effects.
5.7.1 Bring to us, stand not about, O niggard; do not prevent (? ''rakṣ'') our sacrificial gift as led [away]; homage be to baffling (''vīrtsā́''), to ill-success; homage be to the niggard.
5.7.2 What wheedling (? ''parirāpín'') man thou puttest forward, O niggard, to him of thine we pay homage: do not thou disturb my winning (''vaní'').
5.7.3 Let our god-made winning progress (''pra-kḷp'') by day and by night; we go forth after the niggard; homage be to the niggard.
5.7.4 Sarasvatī, Anumati, Bhaga, we going call on; pleasant (''juṣṭá'') honeyed speech have I spoken in the god-invocations of the gods.
5.7.5 Whomever I solicit (''yāc'') with speech, with Sarasvatī, mind-yoked, him may faith find today, given by the brown soma.
5.7.6 Do not thou baffle our winning nor speech. Let Indra and Agni both bring good things to us. De ye all, willing today to give to us, welcome the niggard.
5.7.7 Go thou far away, O ill-success; we conduct away thy missile; I know thee, O niggard, as one putting (? ''mīv'') down, thrusting down.
5.7.8 Likewise, greatly making thyself naked, thou fastenest on (''sac'') a person in dreams, O niggard, baffling the plan and design of a man (''púruṣa'').
5.7.9 She that, being great, of great height (''-unmāna''), permeated all regions - to her, the golden-haired, to perdition have I paid homage.
5.7.10 Gold-colored, fortunate, gold-cushioned, great - to her, the golden-mantled, to the niggard have I paid homage.
;;; 8 Against enemies: to Indra and other gods.
5.8.1 With fuel of ''víkan̄kata'' do thou carry the sacrificial butter to the gods; O Agni, make them revel here; let all come to my call.
5.8.2 O Indra, come to my call; this will I do; that hear thou; let these over-runners (? ''atisará'') of Indra's bring to pass (''sam-nam'') my design; by them may we be equal to (''çak'') heroism, O Jātavedas, self-controller.
5.8.3 What he there yonder, O gods, being godless, desires to do - let not Agni carry his oblation; let not the gods go to his call; come ye only (''evá'') unto my call.
5.8.4 Overrun (''ati-dhāv''), ye over-runners; slay by Indra's spell (''vácas''); shake (''math'') ye as a wolf [shakes] a sheep; let him not be released from you alive; shut up his breath.
5.8.5 What ''brahmán'' they yonder have put forward for failure (''åpabhūti''), [be] he beneath thy feet, O Indra; him I cast unto death.
5.8.6 If they have gone forward to the gods' strongholds (''-purā''), have made incantation (''bráhman'') their defenses - if (? ''yát'') making a body-protection, a complete protection, they have encouraged themselves (''upa-vac''): all that do thou make sapless.
5.8.7 What over-runners he yonder has made, and what he shall make, do thou, O Indra, Vṛtra-slayer, turn (''ā-kṛ'') them back again, that they may shatter (''tṛh'') yon person (''jána'').
5.8.8 As Indra, taking Udvācana, put [him] underneath his feet, so do I put down them yonder, through everlasting (''çáçvat'') years (''sámā'').
5.8.9 Here, O Indra, Vṛtra-slayer, do thou, formidable, pierce them in the vitals; just here do thou trample upon them; O Indra, thine ally am I; we take hold on thee, O Indra; may we be in thy favor.
;;; 9 For protection: to various gods.
5.9.1 To heaven hail!
5.9.2 To earth hail!
5.9.3 To atmosphere hail!
5.9.4 To atmosphere hail!
5.9.5 To heaven hail!
5.9.6 To earth hail!
5.9.7 The sun my eye, wind my breath, atmosphere my soul (''ātmán''), earth my body; unquelled (''astṛtá'') by name am I here; [as] such I deposit myself for heaven and earth to guard (''gopīthá'').
5.9.8 Up life-time, up strength, up act (''kṛtá''), up action (''kṛtyā́''), up skill (''manīṣā́''), up sense (''indriyá''); O life- (''ā́yus-'') maker, O ye (two) mistresses of life, rich in ''svadhā́''''m''., be ye my guardians, guard me; be my soulsitters; do not harm me.
;;; 10 For defense from all quarters.
5.10.1 My stone-defense art thou; whoever from the eastern quarter, malicious, shall assail me, this may he come upon (''ṛch'').
5.10.2 My stone-defense art thou; whoever from the southern quarter, malicious, shall assail me, this may he come upon (''ṛch'').
5.10.3 My stone-defense art thou; whoever from the western quarter, malicious, shall assail me, this may he come upon (''ṛch'').
5.10.4 My stone-defense art thou; whoever from the northern quarter, malicious, shall assail me, this may he come upon (''ṛch'').
5.10.5 My stone-defense art thou; whoever from the fixed quarter, malicious, shall assail me, this may he come upon (''ṛch'').
5.10.6 My stone-defense art thou; whoever from the upward quarter, malicious, shall assail me, this may he come upon (''ṛch'').
5.10.7 My stone-defense art thou; whoever from the intermediate quarters of the quarters etc. etc.
5.10.8 By the great one (''bṛhát'') I call unto mind; by Mātariçvan, unto breath and expiration; from the sun [I call] sight, from the atmosphere hearing, from the earth body; by Sarasvatī, mind-yoked, we call unto speech.
;;; 11 Dialogue between Varuṇa and Atharvan.
5.11.1 How unto the great Asura didst thou speak here? how, with shining manliness, unto the yellow (''hári'') father? having given, O Varuṇa, a spotted [cow] as sacrificial fee, thou hast with the mind intended (? ''cikits'') re-bestowal (?).
5.11.2 Not at pleasure am I a re-bestower; for examination (?) do I drive home this spotted [cow]; by what poesy (''kā́vya'') now, O Atharvan, [art] thou [poet]? by what that is produced (''jātá'') art thou ''jātávedas?''
5.11.3 I verily am profound by poesy; verily by what is produced I am ''jātávedas;'' not barbarian (''dāsá''), not Aryan, by his might, damageth (''mī'') the course which I shall maintain.
5.11.4 None else than thou is more poet, nor by wisdom (''medhá'') more wise (''dhī́ra''), O Varuṇa, self-ruling one (''svadhā́vant''); thou knowest all these beings; even that wily man (''jána'') now is afraid of thee.
5.11.5 Since thou verily, O self-ruling Varuṇa, knowest all births, O well-conducting one - is there anything else beyond the welkin (''rájas'')? is there anything below what is beyond, O unerring one (? ''amura'')?
5.11.6 There is one other thing beyond the welkin; there is something, hard to attain, hitherward from what is beyond: this I Varuṇa, knowing it, proclaim to thee. Be the ''paṇi'''s of degraded speech; let the barbarians creep (''sṛp'') downward to the earth.
5.11.7 Since thou verily, O Varuṇa, speakest many reproachful things among (as to ?) re-bestowers, do not thou, I pray, belong to (''abhi-bhū'') such ''paṇís;'' let not people call thee ungenerous (''arādhás'').
5.11.8 Let not people call me ungenerous; I give thee back the spotted [cow], O singer; come thou mightily (''çácībhis'') to every song of praise (''stotrá'') of mine, among all human regions (''díç'').
5.11.9 Let uplifted (''ud-yam'') songs of praise of thee come, among all human regions. Give now to me what thou hast not given me; thou art my suitable comrade of seven steps; -
5.11.10 Of us two, O Varuṇa, [there is] the same connection, the same birth (''jā́''). I know that which is of us two this same birth; I give that which I have not given thee; I am thy suitable comrade of seven steps; -
5.11.11 A god, bestower of vigor on a singing god; a sage (''vípra''), of good wisdom for a praising sage. Since thou, O self-ruling Varuṇa, hast generated father Atharvan, connection of the gods, for him do thou make well-extolled generosity; our comrade art thou, and highest connection.
;;; 12 Āprī-hymn: to various divinities.
5.12.1 Kindled this day in the home of man (''mánus''), thou, a god, O Jātavedas, dost sacrifice to the gods; and do thou bring [them], understanding it, O thou of friendly might; thou art a forethoughtful messenger, poet.
5.12.2 O Tanūnapāt (son of thyself?), do thou, anointing with honey (''mádhu'') the roads that go to righteousness (''ṛtá''), sweeten them, O well-tongued one; prospering (''ṛdh'') with prayers (did) the devotions (''mánman'') and the sacrifice, put (''kṛ'') thou also among the gods our service (''adhvará'').
5.12.3 Making oblation do thou, O Agni, to be praised and to be greeted, come in accord with the Vasus. Thou art invoker (''hótṛ'') of the gods, O youthful one (? ''yahvá''); do thou, sent forth, skilled sacrificer (''yájīyaṅs''), sacrifice to them.
5.12.4 The forward ''barhís'', through the fore-region of the earth, is wreathed on this dawn (''vástu''), at the beginning (''ágra'') of the days; it spreads out abroad more widely, pleasant to the gods, to Aditi.
5.12.5 Expansive let them open (''vi-çri'') widely, like wives adorned for their husbands; ye great, divine, all-furthering doors, be ye favorable to the advance of the gods.
5.12.6 Let Dawn and Night, dripping (? ''suṣvay-''), worshipful, close, sit down here in the lair (''yóni'') - the two heavenly, great, well-shining women, putting on beauty (''çrī́'') with bright adornment.
5.12.7 The (two) invokers of the gods, first, well-voiced, shaping (''mā'') the sacrifice for man (''mánus'') to sacrifice, urging forward at the councils (''vidátha'') the (two) singers (''kārú''), pointing out forward light through the fore-region.
5.12.8 Unto our sacrifice let Bhāratī come quickly, let Iḍā, taking note here in human fashion; let the three goddesses, well-working, sit upon this pleasant ''barhís'' - [also] Sarasvatī.
5.12.9 To him, god Tvashṭar, who adorned (''piç'') with forms these two generatresses, heaven-and-earth, [and] all existences, do thou today, O invoker, sent forth, skilled sacrificer, sacrifice here, understanding it.
5.12.10 In thy way (? ''tmányā'') anointing them, pour thou down upon (''upa-ava-sṛj'') the track of the gods the oblations in due season; let the forest-tree, the queller (''çamitár''), god Agni, relish (''svad'') the oblation with honey, with ghee.
5.12.12 At once, when born, he determined (''vi-mā'') the sacrifice; Agni became foremost of the gods; at the direction of this invoker, at the voice of righteousness (''ṛtá''), let the gods eat the oblation made with "hail!"
;;; 13 Against snakes' poison.
5.13.1 Since Varuṇa, poet of heaven, hath given [them] to me, with formidable spells (''vácas'') do I dissolve thy poison; what is dug, undug, and attached (''saktá'') have I seized; like drink (''írā'') on a waste hath thy poison been wasted (''ni-jas'').
5.13.2 What waterless poison is thine, that of thine have I seized in these; I seize thy midmost, thine upmost juice (''rása''); also may thy lowest then disappear for fright.
5.13.3 A bull [is] my cry, like thunder through the cloud (''nábhas''); with thy formidable spell do I then drive it off (''bādh'') for thee; I have seized that juice of his with men ?; like light out of darkness let the sun arise.
5.13.4 With sight I smite thy sight; with poison I smite thy poison; die, O snake, do not live; let thy poison go back against thee.
5.13.5 O Kirātan, O spotted one, O grass-haunter (?), O brown one! listen ye to me, O black serpents, offensive ones! stand ye not upon the track (? ''stāmán'') of my comrade; calling out (''ā-çrāvay''), rest quiet in poison.
5.13.6 Of the Timātan (?) black serpent, of the brown, and of the waterless, of the altogether powerful (?), I relax the fury, as the bow-string of a bow; I release as it were chariots.
5.13.7 Both ''ā́ligī'' and ''víligī'', both father and mother - we know your connection (''bándhu'') completely; sapless ones, what will ye do?
5.13.8 Daughter of the broad-knobbed one (?), born of the black barbarian (f.) - of all them (f.) that have pierced defiantly (?) the poison [is] sapless.
5.13.9 The eared hedgehog said this, coming down from the mountain: whichsoever of these (f.) are produced by digging, of them the poison is most sapless.
5.13.10 ''Tābúva'', not ''tābúva;'' verily thou art not ''tābúva;'' by ''tābúva'' [is] the poison sapless.
5.13.11 ''Tastúva'', not ''tastúva;'' verily thou art not ''tastúva;'' by ''tastúva'' [is] the poison sapless.
;;; 14 Against witchcraft: with a plant.
5.14.1 An eagle (''suparṇá'') discovered thee; a hog dug thee with his snout; seek thou to injure, O herb, him that seeks to injure; smite down the witchcraft-maker.
5.14.2 Smite down the sorcerers, smite down the witchcraft-maker; then, whoever seeks to injure us, him do thou smite, O herb.
5.14.3 Having cut around out of [his] skin a strip (''pariçāsá''), as it were of a stag, fasten, O gods, upon the witchcraft-maker the witchcraft, like a necklace.
5.14.4 Lead thou away the witchcraft back to the witchcraft-maker, grasping its hand; set it straight before (''samakṣám'') him, that it may smite the witchcraft-maker.
5.14.5 Be the witchcrafts for the witchcraft-maker, the curse for him that curses; like an easy chariot let the witchcraft roll back to the witchcraft-maker.
5.14.6 If woman, or if man, hath made witchcraft in order to evil, it we conduct unto him, like a horse by a horse-halter.
5.14.7 If either thou art god-made, or if made by man, thee, being such, do we lead back, with Indra as ally.
5.14.8 O Agni, overpowerer of fighters, overpower the fighters; we take the witchcraft back to the witchcraft-maker by a returner.
5.14.9 O practiced piercer (?), pierce him; whoever made [it], him do thou smite; we do not sharpen thee up to slay (''vadhá'') him who has not made [it].
5.14.10 Go as a son to a father; like a constrictor trampled on, bite; go, O witchcraft, back to the witchcraft-maker, as it were treading down [thy] bond.
5.14.11 Up, like a she-antelope (''eṇī́''), a she-elephant (? ''vāraṇī́''), with leaping on, like a hind, let the witchcraft go to its maker.
5.14.12 Straighter than an arrow let it fly, O heaven-and-earth, to meet him; let it, the witchcraft, seize again him, the witchcraft-maker, like a deer.
5.14.13 Let it go like fire up-stream, like water down-stream; like an easyc hariot let the witchcraft roll back to the witchcraft-maker.
;;; 15 For exorcism: to a plant.
5.15.1 Both one of me and ten of me [are] the exorcisers (''apavaktár''), O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.
5.15.2 Both two of me and twenty of me [are] the exorcisers (''apavaktár''), O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.
5.15.3 Both three of me and thirty of me [are] the exorcisers (''apavaktár''), O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.
5.15.4 Both four of me and forty of me [are] the exorcisers (''apavaktár''), O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.
5.15.5 Both five of me and fifty of me [are] the exorcisers (''apavaktár''), O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.
5.15.6 Both six of me and sixty of me [are] the exorcisers (''apavaktár''), O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.
5.15.7 Both seven of me and seventy of me [are] the exorcisers (''apavaktár''), O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.
5.15.8 Both eight of me and eighty of me [are] the exorcisers (''apavaktár''), O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.
5.15.9 Both nine of me and ninety of me [are] the exorcisers (''apavaktár''), O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.
5.15.10 Both ten of me and a hundred of me [are] the exorcisers (''apavaktár''), O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.
5.15.11 Both a hundred of me and a thousand [are] the exorcisers, O herb; thou born of right (''ṛtá''), thou rich in right, mayest thou, honeyed (''madhulā́''), make honey for me.

5.16.10 If thou art ten times chief, let go; sapless art thou.
5.16.11 If thou art eleven-fold, then thou art waterless.
;;; 17 The Brahman's wife.
5.17.1 These spoke first at the offense against the Brahman (''bráhman-''): the boundless sea, Mātariçvan, he of stout rage (''-háras''), formidable fervor, the kindly one, the heavenly waters, first-born of right (''ṛtá'').
5.17.2 King Soma first gave (''pra-yam'') back the Brahman's wife, not bearing enmity; he who went after [her] was Varuṇa, Mitra; Agni, invoker, conducted [her] hither, seizing her hand.
5.17.3 To be seized by the hand indeed is the pledge (? ''ādhí'') of her, if one has said "[she is] the Brahman's wife"; she stood not to be sent forth for a messenger: so is made safe (''gupitá'') the kingdom of the Kshatriya.
5.17.4 The misfortune, descending (''ava-pad'') upon the village, of which they say "this is a star with disheveled hair" - as such, the Brahman's wife burns up the kingdom, where hath gone forth a hare (? ''çaçá'') accompanied with meteors (''ulkuṣī́''-).
5.17.5 The Vedic student (''brahmacārin'') goes about serving (''viṣ'') much service; he becomes one limb of the gods; by him Brihaspati discovered the wife, conducted by Soma, like the sacrificial spoon, O gods.
5.17.6 The gods of old verily spoke about her, the seven seers who sat down with penance (''tápas''); fearful [is] the wife of the Brahman when led away; she makes (''dhā'') discomfort (''durdhā́'') in the highest firmament (''vyòman'').
5.17.7 What embryos are aborted (''ava-pad''), what living creatures (''jágat'') are torn away (''apa-lup''), what heroes are mutually shattered - them the Brahman's wife injures.
5.17.8 And if [there were] ten former husbands of a woman, not Brahmans - provided a Brahman has seized her hand, he is alone her husband.
5.17.9 A Brahman [is] indeed her husband, not a noble (''rājanyà''), not a Vāiçya: this the sun goes proclaiming to the five races of men (''mānavá'').
5.17.10 The gods verily gave back; men (''manuṣyà'') gave back; kings, apprehending (''grah'') truth, gave back the Brahman's wife.
5.17.11 Having given back the Brahman's wife, having brought about (''kṛ'') freedom of offense with the gods, sharing (''bhaj'') the refreshment (''ū́rj'') of the earth, they occupy (''upa-ās'') broad space (''urugyá'').
5.17.12 Not on his couch lies a beautiful hundred-bringing (''-vāhī́'') wife, in whose kingdom the Brahman's wife is obstructed through ignorance.
5.17.13 A wide-eared, broad-headed [ox?] is not born in that dwelling, in whose kingdom the Brahman's wife is obstructed through ignorance.
5.17.14 A distributer (''kṣattár'') with necklaced neck goes not at the head of his crates (? ''sūnā́'') [of food], in whose kingdom the Brahman's wife is obstructed through ignorance.
5.17.15 A white, black-eared [horse] does not make a show (''mahīy''), harnessed to his [chariot-] pole, in whose kingdom the Brahman's wife is obstructed through ignorance.
5.17.16 Not in his field [is] a lotus-pond, the bulb (? ''bísa'') of the bulb-bearing lotus is not produced (''jan''), in whose kingdom the Brahman's wife is obstructed through ignorance.
5.17.17 Not for him do they who attend to (''upa-ās'') her milking milk out the spotted [cow], in whose kingdom the Brahman's wife is obstructed through ignorance.
5.17.18 Not his [is] a beautiful milch-cow, [his] draft-ox endures not the pole, where a Brahman stays a night miserably (''pāpáyā'') without a wife (''-jāni'').
;;; 18 The Brahman's cow.
5.18.1 Her the gods did not give thee for thee to eat, O lord of men (''nṛpáti''); do not thou, O noble, desire to devour (''ghas'') the cow of the Brahman, that is not to be eaten.
5.18.2 A noble hated of the dice, evil, self-ruined (''-párājita'') - he may eat the cow of the Brahman: "let me live today, not tomorrow."
5.18.3 Like an ill-poisonous adder enveloped with [cow-] hide, this cow of the Brahman, O noble, is harsh, not to be eaten.
5.18.4 Verily it conducts away his authority, smites his splendor; like fire taken hold of it burns up all; he who thinks the Brahman to be food, he drinks of Timātan poison.
5.18.5 Whatever insulter of the gods, desirous of riches, not from knowledge, slays him, thinking him gentle, in his heart Indra kindles a fire; both the firmaments (''nábhas'') hate him as he goes about.
5.18.6 The Brahman is not to be injured, like fire, by one who holds himself dear; for Soma is his heir, Indra his protector against imprecation.
5.18.7 He swallows down what (f.) has a hundred barbs; he is not able to tear it out - the fool who thinks of the food of Brahmans "I am eating what is sweet."
5.18.8 His tongue becomes a bow-string, his voice an [arrow-] neck, his teeth [become] shafts (''nāḍīkā́'') smeared with penance; with these the Brahman (''brahmán'') pierces the insulters of the gods, with bows having force from the heart [and] speeded by the gods.
5.18.9 The Brahmans have sharp arrows, have missiles; what volley (''çaravyā̀'') they hurl, it is not in vain; pursuing (''anu-hā'') with fervor and with fury, they split him down even from afar.
5.18.10 They that ruled, a thousand, and were ten hundreds, those Vāitahavyas, having devoured the cow of the Brahman, perished (''parā-bhū'').
5.18.11 The cow herself, being slain, pulled down those Vāitahavyas, who cooked the last she-goat of Kesaraprābandhā (?).
5.18.12 Those hundred and one fellows (? ''janátā'') whom the earth shook off, having injured the progeny of the Brahmans, perished irretrievably.
5.18.13 The insulter of the gods goes about among mortals; he becomes one who has swallowed poison, [becomes] mainly composed of bones; he who injures the Brahman, the connection of the gods, he goes not to the world to which the Fathers go.
5.18.14 Agni verily our guide. Soma is called [our] heir, Indra slayer of imprecation (?): so know the devout that.
5.18.15 Like an arrow smeared [with poison], O lord of men, like an adder, O lord of cattle - that arrow of the Brahman is terrible; with it he pierces the insulting.
;;; 19 The Brahman's cow.
5.19.1 They grew excessively; they did not quite (''iva'') touch up to the sky; having injured Bhrigu, the Sriñjayas, Vāitahavyas, perished.
5.19.2 The people who delivered up (? ''arpay-'') the Brahman Brihatsāman, descendant of An̄giras - a he-goat with two rows of teeth, a sheep, consumed (''av'') their offspring (''toká'').
5.19.3 They who spat upon a Brahman, or who sent [their] mucus at him - they sit in the midst of a stream of blood, devouring hair.
5.19.4 The Brahman's cow, being cooked, as far as she penetrates (?), smites out the brightness (''téjas'') of a kingdom; no virile (''vṛ́ṣan'') hero is born [there].
5.19.5 Cruel is the cutting up of her; harsh to eat (?) is her prepared flesh (''piçitám''); in that the milk (''kṣīrá'') of her is drunk, that verily is an offense against the Fathers.
5.19.6 A king who thinks himself formidable, [and] who desires to devour a Brahman - that kingdom is poured away, where a Brahman is scathed (''jyā'').
5.19.7 Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed, two-mouthed, two-tongued, she shakes down the kingdom of the Brahman-scather.
5.19.8 It leaks verily into that kingdom, as water into a split boat (''nāú''); where they injure a Brahman, that kingdom misfortune smites.
5.19.9 Him the trees drive away, saying "do not come unto our shadow," who, O Nārada, plots against that which is the riches of the Brahman.
5.19.10 King Varuṇa called that a god-made poison; no one soever, having devoured the cow of the Brahman, keeps watch in the kingdom.
5.19.11 Those same nine nineties whom the earth shook off, having injured the progeny of the Brahman, perished irretrievably.
5.19.12 The ''kūdī́'' which they tie on after a dead man, as effacer (?) of the track, that verily, O Brahman-scather, did the gods call thy couch (''upastáraṇa'').
5.19.13 The tears of one weeping (''kṛp''), which rolled [down] when he was scathed, these verily, O Brahman-scather, did the gods maintain as thy portion of water.
5.19.14 With what they bathe a dead man, with what they wet (''ud'') beards, that verily, O Brahman-scather, did the gods maintain as thy portion of water.

5.22.7 O fever, go to the Mūjavants, or to the Balhikas, further off; seek the wanton Çūdra woman; her, O fever, do thou shake up a bit (''iva'').
5.22.8 Going away, eat thou thy connection (''bándhu''), the Mahāvrishas [and] Mūjavants; those [fields] we announce to the fever; others' fields verily [are] these.
5.22.9 In another's field thou restest (''ram'') not; being in control, mayest thou be gracious to us; the fever hath become ready (?); it will go to the Balhikas.
5.22.10 In that thou, being cold, then hot (''rūrá''), didst cause trembling, together with cough - fearful are thy missiles, O fever; with them do thou avoid us.
5.22.11 Do not thou make them thy companions - the ''balā́sa'', the cough, the ''udyugá'' (?); come not back hitherward from there: for that, O fever, I appeal to thee.
5.22.12 O fever, together with thy brother the ''balā́sa'' [and] thy sister the cough, together with thy cousin the scab (''pāmán''), go to yon foreign people.

5.23.10 Like Atri I slay you, O worms, like Kaṇva, like Jamadagni; with the incantation of Agastya I mash together the worms.
5.23.11 Slain is the king of the worms, also the chief of them is slain; slain is the worm, having its mother slain, its brother slain, its sister slain.
5.23.12 Slain are its neighbors, slain its further neighbors, also those that are petty, as it were - all those worms are slain.

;;; 30 To the çamī́ plant: for benefit to the hair.
6.30.1 This barley, combined with honey, the gods plowed much on the Sarasvatī, in behalf of Manu (?); Indra, of a hundred abilities, was furrow-master; the liberal (? ''sudā́nu'') Maruts were the plowmen.
6.30.2 The intoxication that is thine, with loosened hair, with disheveled hair, wherewith thou makest a man to be laughed at - far from thee do I wrench [out] other woods; do thou, O ''çamī́'', grow up with a hundred twigs.

6.32.3 Fearlessness, O Mitra-and-Varuṇa, be ours here; drive ye backward the devourers with your gleam; let them not find a knower, nor a foundation (''pratiṣṭhā́''); mutually destroying one another let them go unto death.

6.33.1 Of whom the welkin (''rájas'') here [is] the allies, [who] thrusts (?) people, the wood, the heaven - great [is] Indra's gladness.
6.33.2 [He is] not to be dared against; [his] might, dared, dares daring against [others]; as, of old, his fame [was] unwavering, Indra's might [is] not to be dared against.

6.35.3 May Vāiçvānara shape the praise and song of the An̄girases; may he extend to them brightness (''dyumná'') [and] heaven (''svàr'').
;;; 36 In praise of Agni.
6.36.1 To Vāiçvānara, the righteous, lord of right, of light, we pray for unfailing heat (''gharmá'').
6.36.2 He shaped himself unto all things; he, the controlling one, sends out the seasons, drawing out the vigor (''váyas'') of the sacrifice.
6.36.3 Agni, in distant domains, the desire of what is and is to be, bears rule as the one universal ruler.
;;; 37 Against curses.
6.37.1 Hither hath come forth, having harnessed his chariot, the thousand-eyed curse, seeking after my curser, as a wolf the house of a sheepowner.
6.37.2 Avoid us, O curse, as a burning fire a pond; smite our curser here, as the bolt from heaven a tree.
6.37.3 Whoever shall curse us not cursing, and whoever shall curse us cursing, him, withered (?), I cast forth for death, as a bone (?) for a dog.

6.42.1 As the string from the bow, do I relax (''ava-tan'') fury from thy heart, that, becoming like-minded, we (two) may hold together (''sac'') like friends.
6.42.2 We (two) will hold together like friends; I relax thy fury; we cast in thy fury under a stone that is heavy.
6.42.3 I trample upon (''abhi-sthā'') thy fury, with heel and with front foot, that thou mayest speak not uncontrolled, mayest come unto my intent.
;;; 43 To assuage wrath.
6.43.1 This ''darbhá'' [is] fury-removing, both for one's own man and for a stranger; and this is called a fury-removing fury-appeaser of fury.
6.43.2 This that is many-rooted, [that] reaches down (''ava-sthā'') to the sea, the ''darbhá'', arisen out of the earth, is called a fury-appeaser.

;;; 44 For cessation of a disease.
6.44.1 The heaven hath stood; the earth hath stood; all this living world hath stood; the trees have stood, sleeping erect; may this disease of thine stand.

6.44.3 Rudra's urine art thou, the navel of the immortal (''amṛ́ta''); ''viṣāṇakā́'' ('horny') by name art thou, arisen from the root of the Fathers, an effacer of the ''vātī́kṛta''.

6.45.1 Go far away, O mind-evil! why utterest (''çaṅs'') thou things unuttered? Go away; I desire thee not; do thou frequent (''sam-cara'') trees, woods; in houses, in kine [is] my mind.
6.45.2 If (''yát'') by down-utterance, out-utterance, forth-utterance we have offended (''upa-ṛ''), waking or (''yát'') sleeping, let Agni put far away from us all disagreeable ill-deeds.
6.45.3 If (''yát''), O Indra, O Brahmaṇaspati, we also proceed falsely, let the Ān̄girasa, forethoughtful, protect us from difficulty, from distress.
;;; 46 Against evil dreams.
6.46.1 Thou who art not alive, not dead, immortal-embryo of the gods art thou, O sleep; ''Varuṇāni'' is thy mother, Yama thy father; Araru by name art thou.
6.46.2 We know thy place of birth (''janítra''), O sleep; thou art son of the gods' sisters (''-jāmí''), agent of Yama; end-maker art thou; death art thou; so, O sleep, do we comprehend thee here; do thou, O sleep, protect us from evil-dreaming.

6.47.2 May all the gods, the Maruts, Indra, not leave us at this second libation; long-lived, speaking what is dear to them, may we be in the favor of the gods.
6.47.3 This third libation [is] of the poets (''kaví''), who rightfully (''ṛténa'') sent out the bowl; let those Sāudhanvanas, who have attained heaven, conduct our happy-offering unto what is better.
;;; 48 To the deities of the three daily libations.
6.48.1 A falcon art thou, with ''gāyatrá'' for meter; I take hold after thee; carry me along to welfare at the close (''udṛ́c'') of this offering: hail!

;;; 49 To Agni etc.
6.49.1 Surely no mortal, O Agni, hath attained the cruelty of thy self (''tanū́''). The ape gnaws (''bhas'') the shaft (''téjana''), as a cow her own after-birth.
6.49.2 Like a ram, thou art bent both together and wide apart, when in the upper wood [the upper] and the lower stone devour; exciting (''ard'') head with head, breast (''ápsas'') with breast, he gnaws the soma-stalks (''aṅçu'') with green mouths.
6.49.3 The eagles have uttered (''kṛ'') their voice close in the sky; in the lair (''ākhará'') the black lively ones have danced; when they come down to the removal of the lower [stone], they have assumed much seed, they that resort to the sun.
;;; 50 Against petty destroyers of grain.
6.50.1 Smite, O Açvins, the borer, the ''samān̄ká'', the rat; split their head; crush in their ribs; lest they eat the barley, shut up their mouth; then make fearlessness for the grain.
6.50.2 Hey, borer! hey, locust! hey, grinder, ''upakvasa!'' as a priest (''brahman'') an unfinished oblation, not eating this barley, go up away, doing no harm.
6.50.3 O lord of borers, lord of ''vághā's!'' with arid jaws do ye (pl.) listen to me: what devourers (''vyadvará'') there are of the forest, and whatever devourers ye are, all them do we grind up.
;;; 51 For various blessings.
6.51.1 Purified with Vāyu's purifier, Soma [hath] run over opposite (''pratyán̄''), Indra's suitable companion.
6.51.2 Let the mother waters further (''sūd'') us; let the ghee-purifying ones purify us with ghee; since the heavenly ones carry forth all evil (''riprá''), forth from them, indeed, I come clean, purified.

6.53.3 We have become united with splendor, with fatness (''páyas''), with bodies (''tanū́''), with propitious mind; let Tvashṭar make for us here wider room; let him smooth down what of our body is torn apart.
;;; 54 To secure and increase some one's superiority.
6.54.1 Now do I adorn this man as superior to his fellow, for attainment of Indra; do thou increase his authority, his great fortune, as the rain the grass.
6.54.2 For him, O Agni-and-Soma, maintain ye dominion, for him wealth; in the sphere of royalty make ye him superior to his fellow.

;;; 57 With a certain remedy against disease.
6.57.1 This verily is a remedy; this is Rudra's remedy; wherewith one may spell away (''apa-brū'') the one-shafted (''-téjana''), hundred-tipped arrow.
6.57.2 Pour ye on with the ''jālāṣá;'' pour in with the ''jālāṣá;'' the ''jālāṣá'' is a formidable remedy; with it do thou be gracious to us, unto life (''jīvás'').
6.57.3 [Be there] both weal for us and kindness (''máyas'') for us, and let nothing whatever ail (''am'') us; down with [our] complaint (''rápas'')! be every remedy ours; be all remedy ours.
;;; 58 For glory.
6.58.1 Glorious let the bounteous Indra make me; glorious both heaven-and-earth here; glorious let god Savitar make me; may I be dear here to the giver of the sacrificial gift.
6.58.2 As Indra is possessed of glory in heaven-and-earth, as the waters are possessed of glory in the herbs, so among all the gods may we, among all, be glorious.
6.58.3 Glorious was Indra, glorious was Agni, glorious was Soma born; glorious, of all existence am I most glorious.

6.59.1 To the draft-oxen do thou first, to the milch kine do thou, O ''arundhatī́'', to the non-milch cow, in order to vigor (''váyas''), to four-footed creatures do thou yield protection.
6.59.2 Let the herb, the ''arundhatī́'', allied with the gods (?), yield protection; may it make the cow-stall rich in milk, and the men (''púruṣa'') free from disease (''yákṣma'').
6.59.3 I appeal to the all-formed, well-portioned, vivifying one; let it conduct the hurled missile of Rudra far away from our kine.
;;; 60 For winning a spouse.
6.60.1 Here cometh Aryaman, with locks -''stupá'' loosened in front, seeking a husband for this spinster, and a wife for a wifeless one.
6.60.2 This woman, O Aryaman, hath toiled, going to other women's assembly; now, O Aryaman, shall another woman come to her assembly.
6.60.3 The creator (''dhātár'') sustains the earth; the creator [sustains] the sky and the sun; let the creator assign (''dhā'') to this spinster a husband that is according to her wish.

6.65.2 The handless shaft, O gods, which ye cast at the handless ones - I hew [off] the arms of the foes with this oblation.

;;; 5 Mystic: on the offering or sacrifice.
7.5.1 By the sacrifice the gods sacrificed to the sacrifice; those were the first ordinances (''dhárman''); those greatnesses attach themselves to (''sac'') the firmament, where are the ancient (''pū́rva'') perfectible (''sādhyá'') gods.

7.12.2 We know thy name, O assembly; verily sport (''naríṣṭā'') by name art thou; whoever are thine assembly-sitters, let them be of like speech with me.
7.12.3 Of these that sit together I take to myself the splendor, the discernment (''vijñā́na''); of this whole gathering (''saṁsád'') make me, O Indra, possessor of the fortune (''bhagín'').
7.12.4 Your mind that is gone away, that is bound either here or here - that of you we cause to turn hither; in me let your mind rest.
;;; 13 Against one's foes.
7.13.1 As the sun rising takes to itself the brilliancies (''téjas'') of the asterisms, so of both women and men that hate me I take to myself the splendor.

7.26.2 So Vishnu praises forth his heroisms, like a fearful wild beast, wandering, mountain-staying, - From distant distance may he come hither. -
7.26.3 Upon whose three wide out-stridings dwell all beings. Widely, O Vishnu, stride out; widely make us to dwell; drink the ghee, O thou ghee-wombed one; prolong the master of the sacrifice on and on.

7.50.4 May we, with thee as ally, conquer the troop (? ''vṛt'') do thou help upward our side in every conflict; for us, O Indra, make thou wide space, easy-going; do thou break up the virilities of our foes, O bounteous one.
7.50.5 I have won of thee what is scored together (?); I have won also the check (?); as a wolf might shake a sheep, so I shake thy winnings.
7.50.6 Also, a superior player, he wins the advance (?); he divides in time the winnings like a gambler; he who, a god-lover, obstructs not riches - him verily he unites with wealth at pleasure (?).
7.50.7 By kine may we pass over ill-conditioned misery, or by barley over hunger, O much-invoked one, all of us; may we first among kings, unharmed, win riches by [our] stratagems.
7.50.8 My winnings in my right hand, victory in my left is placed; kine-winner may I be, horse-winner, riches-winning, gold-winner.
7.50.9 O ye dice, give [me] fruitful play, like a milking cow; fasten me together with a stream (?) of winnings, as a bow with sinew.
;;; 51 For protection by Brihaspati and Indra.
7.51.1 Let Brihaspati protect us round about from behind, also from above, from below, against the malignant one; let Indra from in front and from midway make wide space for us, a companion for companions.
;;; 52 For harmony.
7.52.1 Harmony for us with our own men, harmony with strangers - harmony, O Açvins, do ye here confirm in us.
7.52.2 May we be harmonious with mind, with knowledge (''cikitú''); may we not fight (?) with the mind of the gods; let not noises arise in case of much destruction (?); let not Indra's arrow fall, the day being come.
;;; 53 For some one's health and long life.
7.53.1 When thou, O Brihaspati, didst release [us] from Yama's otherworld existence, from malediction, the Açvins bore back death from us, O Agni, physicians of the gods, mightily.
7.53.2 Walk (''kram'') ye (two) together; leave not the body; let thy breath and expiration be here allies; live thou increasing a hundred autumns; [be] Agni thy best over-ruling shepherd.
7.53.3 Thy life-time that is set over at a distance - [thy] expiration, breath, let them come again - Agni hath taken that from the lap of perdition; that I cause to enter again in thy self.
7.53.4 Let not breath leave this man; let not expiration, leaving him low, go away; I commit him to the seven sages (''ṛ́ṣi''); let them carry him happily (''svastí'') unto old age.
7.53.5 Enter ye in, O breath and expiration, as (two) draft-oxen a stall; let this treasure of old age increase here unharmed.
7.53.6 We impel hither thy breath; I impel away thy ''yákṣma;'' let Agni here, desirable one, assign us life-time from all sides.
7.53.7 Up out of darkness have we, ascending the highest firmament, gone to the sun, god among the gods, highest light.
;;; 54 Extolling verse and chant.
7.54.1 To verse (''ṛ́c''), to chant (''sā́man'') we sacrifice, by (both) which men perform rites (''kárman''); these bear rule at the seat (''sádas''); they hand (''yam'') the offering to the gods.
7.54.2 When (''yád'') I have asked verse and chant respectively for oblation and force, and sacrificial formula (''yájus'') for strength, let not therefore this Veda, asked, injure me, O lord of might (''çácī-'').
;;; 55 To Indra (?).
7.55.1 The paths which are thine, downward from the sky, by which thou didst send the all - by those, O Vasu, do thou set us in what is pleasant.
;;; 56 Against poison of snakes and insects.
7.56.1 From the cross-lined [snake], from the black snake, from the adder (''pṛ́dāku'') [what is] gathered - that poison of the heron-jointed (?) one hath this plant made to disappear.
7.56.2 This plant [is] sweet-(''mádhu-'')born, sweet-dripping, sweetish, sweet; it is the remedy of what is dissevered (''vi-hru''), also grinder-up of stinging insects.
7.56.3 Whence bitten, whence sucked - thence do we call [it] out for thee; of the petty, hastily-biting (?) stinging insect the poison [is] sapless.
7.56.4 Thou who here, crooked, jointless, limbless, makest crooked twisted (''vṛjiná'') faces - those [faces] mayest thou, O Brahmaṇaspati, bend together like a reed.
7.56.5 Of the sapless ''çarkóṭa'', crawling on, on the ground (''nīcī́na'') - its poison, verily, I have taken away, likewise I have ground it up.
7.56.6 Not in thy (two) arms is there strength, not in thy head, nor in thy middle; then what petty thing bearest thou in that evil way in thy tail?
7.56.7 Ants eat thee; pea-hens pick thee to pieces; verily may ye all say "the poison of the ''çarkóṭa'' is sapless."
7.56.8 Thou that strikest (''pra-hṛ'') with both, with both tail and mouth - in thy mouth is no poison; how then may there be in thy tail-receptacle?
;;; 57 Prayer to Sarasvati etc.
7.57.1 What has gone wrong (''vi-kṣubh'') on the part of me speaking with expectation, what of [me] going about among people begging, what in myself of my body is torn apart - that may Sarasvatī fill up with ghee.
7.57.2 Seven flow for the Marut-accompanied young one (''çíçu''); for the father the sons have made to understand righteous things; both indeed bear rule over this of both kinds; both strive, both prosper (''puṣ'') of it.
;;; 58 Invitation to Indra and Varuṇa.
7.58.1 O Indra-and-Varuṇa, soma-drinkers, this pressed soma, intoxicating, drink ye, O ye of firm courses; let your chariot, the sacrifice (? ''adhvará''), for the god-feast, approach toward the stall (''svásara''), to drink.
7.58.2 O Indra-and-Varuṇa, of the bull soma, most rich in sweet, pour in, ye bulls; here is your beverage (''ándhas''), poured about; sitting on this ''barhís'', do ye revel.
;;; 59 Against cursers.
7.59.1 Whoever shall curse us not cursing, and whoever shall curse us cursing, like a tree smitten by a thunderbolt, let him dry up from the root.
;;; 60 To the home: on returning or leaving.
7.60.1 Bearing sustenance (''ū́rj''), good-winning, very wise, with mild friendly eye, I come to the houses, well-willing, greeting; be quiet, be not afraid of me.
7.60.2 These houses [are] kindly, rich in sustenance (''ūrjas-''), rich in milk, standing filled with what is pleasant; let them recognize us coming.
7.60.3 On whom the absent one thinks (''adhi-i''), in whom is abundant well-willing - the houses we call on; let them recognize us coming.
7.60.4 Called on [are] they of much riches, companions, enjoying sweets together; be ye hungerless, thirstless; ye houses, be not afraid of us.
7.60.5 Called on here [are] the kine, called on the goats and sheep; likewise [is] the sweet drink of food called on in our houses.
7.60.6 Full of pleasantness, well-portioned, full of refreshing drink (''írā''), merry (''hasāmudá''), thirstless, hungerless be ye; O houses, be not afraid of us.
7.60.6 Be ye just here; go not after; adorn yourselves with all forms; I shall come along with what is excellent; become ye more abundant through me.
;;; 61 For success of penance.
7.61.1 In that, O Agni, penance with penance, we perform additional (?) penance, may we be dear to what is heard, long-lived, very wise.
7.61.2 O Agni, we perform penance, we perform additional penance - we, hearing things heard, long-lived, very wise.
;;; 62 To Agni: against enemies.
7.62.1 This Agni, lord of the good, household priest, conquered them of increased virility (?), as a chariot-warrior [conquers] footmen; set down on earth in the navel, brightly shining, let him put under foot them who desire to fight [us].
;;; 63 To Agni: for aid.
7.63.1 The fight-conquering, overpowering Agni do we call with songs from the highest station; may he pass us across all difficult things; may divine Agni stride (?) across arduous things.
;;; 64 Against evil influence of a black bird.
7.64.1 What here the black bird, flying out upon [it], has made fall - let the waters protect me from all that difficulty, from distress.
7.64.2 What here the black bird hath stroked down with thy mouth, O perdition - let the householder's fire release me from that sin.
;;; 65 To the plant apāmārgá: for cleansing.
7.65.1 Since thou, O off-wiper (''apāmārgá''), hast grown with reverted fruit, mayest thou repel (''yu'') from me all curses very far from here.
7.65.2 What [is] ill-done, what pollution, or what we have practised evilly - by thee, O all-ways-facing off-wiper, we wipe that off (''apa-mṛj'').
7.65.3 If we have been together with one dark-toothed, ill-nailed, mutilated, by thee, O off-wiper, we wipe off all that.
;;; 66 For recovery of sacred knowledge (brā́hmaṇa).
7.66.1 If it was in the atmosphere, if in the wind, if in the trees, or if in the bushes - what the cattle heard uttered - let that ''bráhmaṇa'' come again to us.
;;; 67 For recovery of sense, etc.
7.67.1 Again let sense (''indriyá'') come to me, again soul, property, and ''bráhmaṇa'' (sacred knowledge); let the fires of the sacred hearth again officiate just here in their respective stations.
;;; 68 Praise and prayer to Sarasvatī.
7.68.1 O Sarasvatī, in thy courses, in thy heavenly domains, O goddess, enjoy thou the offered oblation; grant us progeny, O goddess.
7.68.2 This [is] thine oblation, rich in ghee, O Sarasvatī; this the oblation of the Fathers that is to be consumed (?); these thy most wealful utterances; by them may we be rich in sweet.
7.68.3 Be thou propitious, most wealful to us, very gracious, O Sarasvatī; let us not be separated from sight of thee.
;;; 69 Prayer for good fortune.
7.69.1 Weal for us let the wind blow; weal for us let the sun burn; be the days weal for us; [as] weal let the night be applied; weal for us let the dawn shine forth.
;;; 70 Against an enemy's sacrifice.
7.70.1 Whatsoever he yonder offers with mind, and what with voice, with sacrifices, with oblation, with sacred formula (''yájus''), that let perdition, in concord with death, smite, his offering, before it comes true.
7.70.2 The sorcerers, perdition, also the demon - let them smite his truth with untruth; let the gods, sent by Indra, disturb (''math'') his sacrificial butter; let not that meet with success which he yonder offers.
7.70.3 Let the two speedy over-kings, like two falcons flying together, smite the sacrificial butter of the foeman, whosoever shows malice against us.
7.70.4 Turned away [are] both thine arms; I fasten up thy mouth; with the fury of divine Agni - therewith have I smitten thine oblation.
7.70.5 I fasten back thine arms; I fasten up thy mouth; with the fury of terrible Agni - therewith have I smitten thine oblation.
;;; 71 To Agni: for protection.
7.71.1 Thee, the devout ''vípra'', O Agni, powerful one, would we fain put about us [as] a stronghold, [thee] of daring color, day by day, slayer of the destructive one.
;;; 72 With an oblation to Indra.
7.72.1 Stand ye up; look down at Indra's seasonable portion; if cooked, do ye offer [it]: if uncooked, do ye wait (''mad'').
7.72.2 The oblation [is] cooked; hither, O Indra, please come forward; the sun hath gone to the mid-point of his way; [thy] companions wait upon (''pari-ās'') thee with treasures (''nidhí''), as heads of families on a chieftain (''vrājapatí'') as he goes about.
7.72.3 Cooked I think [it] in the udder, cooked in the fire; well cooked I think [it], that newer rite (? ''ṛtá''); of the curds of the midday libation drink thou, O thunderbolt-bearing Indra, much-doing, enjoying [it].
;;; 73 With a heated offering to the Açvins.
7.73.1 Kindled, O ye two bulls, is Agni, the charioteer of heaven; heated is the ''gharmá;'' honey is milked for your food (''íṣ''); for we singers (''kārú''), of many houses, call on you, O Açvins, in joint revelings.
7.73.2 Kindled is Agni, O ye Açvins; heated is your ''gharmá;'' come! now, ye bulls, the milch-kine are milked here, ye wondrous ones (''dasrá'')-, the pious ones are reveling.
7.73.3 The bright (''çúci'') sacrifice to the gods accompanied with "hail," the Açvins' bowl that is for the gods to drink of - this all the immortals, enjoying, lick respectively by the Gandharva's mouth.
7.73.4 The offered ghee, the milk, which is in the ruddy [kine], that is your portion here, ye Açvins; come; ye sweet ones, maintainers of the council (''vidátha''), lords of the good, drink ye the heated ''gharmá'' in the shining space of the sky.
7.73.5 Let the heated ''gharmá'', its own invoker (''hótar''), attain to you; let your offerer (''adhvaryú'') move forward, rich in milk; of the milked sweet, O Açvins, of the offspring (?), eat (''vī'') ye, drink ye, of the milk of the ruddy [cow].
7.73.6 Run up with milk, O cow-milker, quickly; pour in the milk of the ruddy [cow] in the ''gharmá;'' the desirable Savitar hath irradiated (''vi-khyā'') the firmament; after the forerunning of the dawn he shines forth (''vi-rāj'').
7.73.7 I call upon that easy-milking milch-cow; a skilful-handed milker also shall milk her; may the impeller (''savitár'') impel us the best impulse; the hot drink is kindled upon - that may he kindly proclaim.
7.73.8 Lowing (''hin̄-kṛ''), mistress of good things, seeking her calf with her mind, hath she come in; let this inviolable one (''aghnyā́'') yield (''duh'') milk for the Açvins; let her increase unto great good-fortune.
7.73.9 As enjoyable (''júṣṭa'') household guest in our home (''duroṇá''), do thou come, knowing, unto this our sacrifice; smiting away, O Agni, all assaulters (''abhiyúj''), do thou bring in the enjoyments of them that play the foe.
7.73.10 O Agni, be bold unto great good-fortune; let thy brightnesses (''dyumná'') be highest; put together a well-ordered house-headship; trample on the greatnesses of them that play the foe.
7.73.11 Mayest thou verily be well-portioned, feeding in excellent meadows; so also may we be well-portioned; eat thou grass, O inviolable one, at all times; drink clear water, moving hither.
;;; 74 Against apacíts: against jealousy: to Agni.
7.74.1 Of the red ''apacít's'' black is the mother, so have we heard; by the root of the divine anchoret I pierce them all.
7.74.2 I pierce the first of them; I pierce also the midmost; now the hinder one of them I cut into like a tuft (''stúkā'').
7.74.3 With the spell (''vácas'') of Tvashṭar have I confounded thy jealousy; also the fury that is thine, O master (''páti''), that do we appease for thee.
7.74.4 Do thou, O lord of vows, adorned by the vow, shine here always, well-willing; thee being so kindled, O Jātavedas, may we all, rich in progeny, wait upon (''upa-sad'').
;;; 75 Praise and prayer to the kine.
7.75.1 Rich in progeny, shining in good pasture, drinking clear waters at a good watering-place - let not the thief master you, nor the evil-plotter; let Rudra's weapon avoid you.
7.75.2 Track-knowing are ye, staying (''rámati''), united, all-named; come unto me, ye divine ones, with the gods; to this stall, this seat; sprinkle us over with ghee.
;;; 76 Against apacíts and jāyā́nya: etc.
7.76.1 More deciduous (pl.) than the deciduous one, more non-existent than the non-existent ones, more sapless than the ''séhu'', more dissolving than salt.
7.76.2 The ''apacíts'' that are on the neck, likewise those that are along the sides, the ''apacíts'' that are on the perineum (? ''vijā́man''), self-deciduous.
7.76.3 He that crushes up the breast-bone (? ''kī́kasās''), [that] descends to the sole (?) - the whole ''jāyánya'' have I cast out, also whatever one is set in the top.
7.76.4 Having wings, the ''jāyánya'' flies; it enters into a man; this is the remedy of both, of the ''ákṣita'' and of the ''súkṣata''.
7.76.5 We know, indeed, O ''jāyā́nya'', thine origin (''jā́na''), whence, O ''jāyā́nya'', thou art born ''jā́yase''; how shouldst thou smite there, in whose house we perform oblation?
7.76.6 Daringly drink the soma in the mug, O Indra, being a Vritra-slayer, O hero, in the contest for good things; at the midday libation pour [it] down; a ''dépôt'' of wealth, assign wealth to us.
;;; 77 To the Maruts.
7.77.1 Ye much-heating (''sāṁtapaná'') ones, here [is] oblation; enjoy that, ye Maruts; with favor to us, O foe-destroyers (? ''riçā́das'').
7.77.2 Whatever very inimical mortal, O Maruts, desires to smite us, O good ones, across [our] intents, let that man put on the fetters of hate; smite ye him with the hottest heat.
7.77.3 The Maruts, of the year, well-singing, wide-dwelling, troop-attended, humane (''mā́nuṣa'') - let them release from us the fetters of sin, they the much-heating, jovial, reveling.
;;; 78 To Agni: in favor of some one.
7.78.1 I loosen off thy strap, off thy harness, off thy halter; be thou just here, unfailing, O Agni.
7.78.2 Thee, O Agni, maintaining dominions for this man, I harness (''yuj'') with the incantation of the gods; shine thou unto us here excellent property; mayest thou proclaim this man as oblation-giver among the deities.
;;; 79 To Amāvāsyā (night or goddess of new moon).
7.79.1 What portion (''bhāgadhéya'') the gods made for thee, O Amāvāsyā, dwelling together with might, therewith fill our offering, O thou of all choice things; assign to us, O fortunate one, wealth rich in heroes.
7.79.2 I myself am Amāvāsyā; on me, in me dwell these well-doers; in me came together all, of both classes, the gods and the ''sādhyás'', with Indra as chief (''jyéṣṭa'').
7.79.3 The night hath come, assembler of good things, causing sustenance, prosperity, [and] good to enter in; we would worship Amāvāsyā with oblation; yielding (''duh'') sustenance with milk is she come to us.
7.79.4 O Amāvāsyā, no other than thou, encompassing, gave birth to all these forms; what desiring we make libation to thee, be that ours; may we be lords of wealth.
;;; 80 To the night or goddess of full moon (pāurṇamāsī́).
7.80.1 Full behind, also full in front, up from the middle hath she of the full moon been victorious; in her, dwelling together with the gods, with greatness, may we revel together with food (''íṣ'') on the back of the firmament.
7.80.2 We sacrifice to the vigorous bull of the full moon; let him give us unexhausted unfailing wealth.
7.80.3 O Prajāpati, no other than thou, encompassing, gave birth to all these forms; what desiring we make libation to thee, be that ours; may we be lords of wealth.
7.80.4 She of the full moon was the first worshipful one in the depths (?) of days, of nights. They who, O worshipful one, gratify (''ardháya-'') thee with offerings, those well-doers are entered into thy firmament.
;;; 81 To the sun and moon.
7.81.1 These two move on one after the other by magic (''māyā́''); two playing young ones (''çíçu''), they go about the sea; the one looks abroad upon all beings; thou, the other, disposing the seasons art born new.
7.81.2 Ever new art thou, being born; sign (''ketú'') of the days, thou goest to the apex (''ágra'') of the dawns; thou disposest their share to the gods as thou comest; thou stretchest out, O moon, a long life-time.
7.81.3 O stem of soma, lord of fighters! not-deficient verily art thou by name; make me, O first-sight (''darçá''), not-deficient, both by progeny and by riches.
7.81.4 First sight art thou, worth seeing art thou; complete at point art thou, complete at end; complete at point, complete at end may I be, by kine, by horses, by progeny, by cattle, by houses, by riches.
7.81.5 He who hateth us, whom we hate - with his breath do thou fill thyself up; may we fill ourselves up with kine, with horses, with progeny, with cattle, with houses, with riches.
7.81.6 The stem which the gods fill up, which, unexhausted, they feed upon unexhausted - therewith let Indra, Varuṇa, Brihaspati, shepherds of existence, fill us up.
;;; 82 Praise and prayer to Agni.
7.82.1 Sing (''arc'') ye good praise unto the contest for kine; put ye in us excellent possessions; lead ye this sacrifice of ours unto the gods; let streams of ghee purify themselves sweetly.
7.82.2 I seize in me Agni at first, together with dominion, splendor, strength; in me I put progeny, in me lifetime, - hail! - in me Agni.
7.82.3 Just here, O Agni, do thou maintain wealth; let not the downputters, with previous intents, put thee down; by dominion, O Agni, be it of easy control for thee; let thine attendant increase, not laid low.
7.82.4 Agni hath looked after the apex of the dawns, after the days, [he] first, Jātavedas, a sun, after the dawns, after the rays, after heaven-and-earth he entered.
7.82.5 Agni hath looked forth to meet the apex of the dawns, to meet the days, [he] first, Jātavedas, and to meet the rays of the sun in many places; to meet heaven-and-earth he stretched out.
7.82.6 Ghee for thee, Agni, in the heavenly station; with ghee Manu kindleth thee today; let the goddesses thy kin (''natpī́'') bring thee ghee; ghee to thee let the kine milk, O Agni.
;;; 83 For release from Varuṇa's fetters.
7.83.1 In the waters, O king Varuṇa, is built for thee a golden house; thence let the king of firm courses release all bonds (''dā́man'').
7.83.2 From every bond, O king, here, O Varuṇa, release us; if "O waters, inviolable ones!" if "O Varuṇa!" we have said, from that, O Varuṇa, release us.
7.83.3 Loosen up the uppermost fetter from us, O Varuṇa, [loosen] down the lowest, off the midmost; then may we, O Āditya, in thy sphere (''vratá''), be guiltless unto Aditi.
7.83.4 Release from us, O Varuṇa, all fetters, that are uppermost, lowest, that are Varuṇa's; remove from us evil-dreaming [and] difficulty; then may we go to the world of the well-done.
;;; 84 To Agni: and to Indra.
7.84.1 O Agni, shine thou here unassailable, Jātavedas, immortal, wide-ruling (''virā́j''), bearing dominion; releasing all diseases by humane, propitious [aids], do thou protect round about today our household.
7.84.2 O Indra, unto dominion, [unto] pleasant force, wast thou born, thou bull of men (''carṣaṇí''); thou didst push away the inimical people; thou didst make wide room for the gods.
7.84.3 Like a fearful wild beast, wandering, mountain-staying, from distant distance may he come hither; sharpening, O Indra, [thy] missile (? ''sṛká''), [thy] keen rim, smite away the foes, push away the scorners.
;;; 85 Invocation of Tārkshya.
7.85.1 We would fain call hither for [our] welfare Tārkshya, this vigorous, god-quickened, powerful overcomer of chariots, Tārkshya, having uninjured tires, fight-conquering, swift.
;;; 86 Invocation of Indra.
7.86.1 The savior Indra, the helper Indra, the hero Indra, of easy call at every call - I call now on the mighty (''çakrá''), much-called Indra; let the bounteous (''maghávan'') Indra make well-being for us.
;;; 87 Homage to Rudra.
7.87.1 The Rudra that is in the fire (''agní''), that is within the waters, that entered the herbs, the plants, that shaped (''kḷp'') all these beings - to that Rudra, to Agni, be homage.
;;; 88 Against poison.
7.88.1 Go away! enemy (''ári'') art thou; enemy verily art thou; in poison hast thou mixed poison; poison verily hast thou mixed; go away straight to the snake; smite that!
;;; 89 To Agni and the waters.
7.89.1 The heavenly waters have I honored (''cāy''); with sap have we been mingled; with milk, O Agni, have I come; me here unite with splendor.
7.89.2 Unite me, O Agni, with splendor, with progeny, with life-time; may the gods know me as such; may Indra know, together with the seers (''ṛ́ṣi'').
7.89.3 O waters, do ye carry forth both this reproach and what is foul (''mála''), and what untruth I have uttered in hate, and what I have sworn fearlessly (?).
7.89.4 Fire-wood (''édhas'') art thou, may I be prosperous (''edh''); fuel (''samidh'') art thou, may I altogether prosper (''sam-edh''); brightness art thou, put thou brightness in me.
;;; 90 To destroy some one's virile power.
7.90.1 Hew on, after ancient fashion, as it were the knot of a creeper; harm the force of the barbarian (''dāsá'').
7.90.2 We, by Indra's aid, will share among us this collected good of his; I relax the vigor (? ''çibhrám'') of thy member (?) by Varuṇa's vow (''vratá'').
7.90.3 That the member may go off, and may be impotent (? ''ánāvayas'') toward women, of the depending, inciting (?), peg-like, in-thrusting one, what is stretched, that do thou unstretch; what is stretched up, that do thou stretch down.
;;; 91 To Indra: for aid.
7.91.1 Let Indra be well-saving, well-aiding with aids, very gracious, all-possessing; let him put down (''bādh'') hatred, let him make for us fearlessness; may we be lords of wealth in heroes.
;;; 92 To Indra: for aid.
7.92.1 Let this Indra, well-saving, well-aiding, keep far away apart from us any hatred; may we be in the favor of him the worshipful, also in his excellent well-willing.
;;; 93 For Indra's aid.
7.93.1 With Indra, with fury may we overcome them that play the foe, smiting Vritras irresistibly.
;;; 94 For Indra's help to unanimity.
7.94.1 Fixed (''dhruvá''), with a fixed oblation, do we lead down Soma, that Indra may make the clans (''víç'') like-minded, wholly ours.
;;; 95 A spell against some one.
7.95.1 Up have flown his two dark-brown (''çyāvá'') quiverers (? ''vithurá''), as two vultures to the sky - up-heater-and-forth-heater, up-heaters of his heart.
7.95.2 I have made them (dual) rise up, like (two) weary-sitting kine, like (two) growling dogs, like (two) lurking (? ''ud-av'') wolves.
7.95.3 The (two) on-thrusters, down-thrusters, also together-thrusters: I shut up his urinator who bore [away] from here - [whether] woman [or] man.
;;; 96 For quiet kidneys (?).
7.96.1 The kine have sat in their seat; the bird has flown to its nest; the mountains have stood in their site; I have made the (two) kidneys stand in their station.

7.97.3 The eager gods, O god, that thou didst bring - them, O Agni, send forward in [thine] own station (''sadhástha''); having eaten, having drunk sweet things, assign to this man good things, ye good ones (''vásu'').

;;; 100 Against bad dreams.
7.100.1 I turn away from evil-dreaming, from bad dreaming, from ill-success (''ábhūti''); I make ''bráhman'' my inner [defense]; [I put] away the pains having the aspect of dreams.

;;; 108 Against enemies: to Agni.
7.108.1 Whoever seeks to harm us in secret, whoever us openly - us, O Agni, one of our people, knowingly, or a stranger - to meet them let the toothed ''áraṇī'' go; let there be of them no abode (''vā́stu''), O Agni, nor offspring.
7.108.2 Whoever shall assail us asleep or waking, standing or moving, O Jātavedas, in accord with Vāiçvānara as ally, do thou meet and burn them out, O Jātavedas.

7.109.2 Do thou, O Agni, carry ghee for the Apsarases, dust for the dice, gravel and waters; enjoying in their respective shares the oblation-giving, the gods revel in both kinds of oblations.
7.109.3 The Apsarases revel a joint reveling, between the oblation-holder (''havirdhā́na'') and the sun; let them unite my hands with ghee; let them make the rival gambler subject to me.
7.109.4 Ill luck (?) to the opposing player; do thou shed upon us with ghee; smite thou him who plays against us as a tree with a thunderbolt.
7.109.5 He who made this riches for our playing, who the taking (?) and leaving of the dice - that god, enjoying this libation of ours - may we revel a joint reveling with the Gandharvas.

7.109.7 If (''yát'') a suppliant I call on the gods, if we have dwelt in Vedic studentship, if I take up the brown dice - let them be gracious to us in such plight.
;;; 110 To Indra and Agni: for help.
7.110.1 O Agni, together with Indra, ye slay the Vritras irresistibly for your worshiper (''dāçvā́ns''); for ye are both best Vritra-slayers.
7.110.2 By whom in the very beginning they won the heaven (''svàr''), who stood unto all existences, the two men-helpers (?), bulls, thunderbolt-armed - Agni, Indra, Vritra-slayers, do I invoke.

;;; 115 Against ill luck.
7.115.1 Fly forth from here, O evil sign (''lakṣmī́''); disappear from here; fly forth from yonder; with a hook of metal (''ayasmáya'') we attach thee to him that hates [us].
7.115.2 The unenjoyable flying sign that hath mounted me, as a creeper a tree - that, O Savitar, mayest thou put hence elsewhere than on us, being golden-handed, granting good to us.
7.115.3 A hundred and one [are] the signs of a mortal, born from his birth together with his body; the worst of these we send forth out from here; to us, O Jātavedas, confirm propitious ones.

;;; 1 For some one's continued life.
8.1.1 To the ender Death [be] homage. Let thy breaths, expirations, rest here. Let this man be here with his life (''ásu''), in the portion of the sun, in the world of the immortal.
8.1.2 Up hath Bhaga taken him, up Soma rich in shoots hath taken him, up the heavenly Maruts have taken him, up have Indra-and-Agni, for his welfare.
8.1.3 Here [be] thy life, here breath, here life-time, here thy mind; we bear thee up from the fetters of perdition with divine speech.
8.1.4 Step up from here, O man, fall not down, loosening down the fetter (''páḍbīça'') of death; be not severed from this world, from the sight (''saṁdṛ́ç'') of fire, of the sun.
8.1.5 Let the wind, Mātariçvan, be cleansing for thee; for thee let the waters rain immortal things; may the sun burn weal for thy body; let death compassionate thee; do not thou perish.
8.1.6 Up-going [be] thine, O man, not down-going; length of life (''jīvā́tu''), ability, I make for thee; for do thou ascend this immortal easy-running chariot, then shalt thou in advanced age (? ''jírvi'') speak to the council (''vidátha'').
8.1.7 Let not thy mind go thither; let it not be lost (''tiró-bhū''); do not neglect (''pra-mad'') the living, go not after the Fathers; let all the gods defend thee here.
8.1.8 Do not regard (''ā-dhī'') the departed, who lead [one] to the distance; ascend out of darkness, come to light; we take hold on thy hands.
8.1.9 Let not the dark and the brindled one, sent forth, [seize] thee, that are Yama's dogs, road-defenders; come thou hitherward; do not hesitate; stand not there with mind averted.
8.1.10 Do not follow that road; that is a frightful one - the one thou hast not gone before, that I speak of; to that darkness, O man, do not go forth; [there is] fear in the distance, safety for thee hitherward.
8.1.11 Let the fires that are within the waters defend thee; let that defend thee which human beings kindle; let Vāiçvānara, Jātavedas defend [thee]; let not [the fire] of heaven consume thee along with the lightning.
8.1.12 Let not the flesh-eating [fire] plot against thee; move far from the destroying (''sáṁkasuka'') one; let heaven defend, let earth defend thee; let both sun and moon defend thee; let the atmosphere defend from the gods' missile.
8.1.13 Let both the knower and the attender defend thee; let both the sleepless one and the unslumbering one defend thee; let both the guardian and the wakeful one protect thee.
8.1.14 Let these defend thee; let these guard thee; to these [be] homage! to these hail!
8.1.15 Let Vāyu, Indra, Dhātar, the preserving Savitar, assign thee unto converse with the living; let not breath, strength, leave thee; we call after thy life.
8.1.16 Let not the jaw-snapping (?) grinder (''jambhá''), let not the darkness find thee, let not the tongue-wrencher (?); how shouldst thou be one that perisheth? up let the Ādityas, the Vasus bear thee, up let Indra-and-Agni, for thy welfare.
8.1.17 Up hath heaven, up hath earth, up hath Prajāpati caught thee; up out of death have the herbs, with Soma for their king, made thee pass.
8.1.18 Be this man just here, O gods; let him not go yonder from hence; him by what is of thousand-fold might do we make pass up out of death.
8.1.19 I have made thee pass up out of death; let the vigor-givers blow together; let not the women of disheveled locks, let not the evil-wailers, wail for thee.
8.1.20 I have taken, I have found thee; thou hast come back renewed; whole-limbed one! I have found thy whole sight, and thy whole life-time.
8.1.21 It hath shone out for thee; it hath become light; darkness hath departed from thee; away from thee we set down death [and] perdition, away the ''yákṣma''.
;;; 2 To prolong some one's life.
8.2.1 Take thou hold. on this bundle (?) of immortality; unsevered length of life be thine; I bring back thy life, [thy] life-time; go not to the welkin (''rájas''), to darkness; do not perish.
8.2.2 Come thou hitherward unto the light of the living; I take thee in order to life for a hundred autumns; loosening down the fetters of death, imprecation, I set for thee further a longer life-time.
8.2.3 From the wind have I found thy breath, from the sun I thy sight; what is thy mind, that I maintain in thee; be in concord with thy limbs; speak with thy tongue, not babbling.
8.2.4 I blow together upon thee with the breath of bipeds [and] quadrupeds as upon [new-] born fire; homage, O death, to thy sight, homage to thy breath have I made.
8.2.5 Let this man live; let him not die; him we send together; I make a remedy for him; death, do not slay the man.
8.2.6 The lively, by-no-means-harming, living herb, the preserving, overpowering, powerful, do I call hither, for this man's freedom from harm.
8.2.7 Bless thou [him]; do not take hold; let him loose; even being thine, let him be one of completed years (?) here; O Bhava-and-Çarva, be ye gracious; yield protection; driving away difficulty, bestow ye life-time.
8.2.8 Bless thou this man, O death; pity him; let him go up from here; unharmed, whole-limbed, well-hearing, hundred-yeared by old age, let him attain enjoyment with himself.
8.2.9 Let the missile of the gods avoid thee; I make thee pass from the welkin (''rájas''); I have made thee pass up out of death; removing afar the flesh-eating Agni, I set for thee an enclosure in order to living.
8.2.10 The down-going in the welkin, not to be ventured down upon, which is thine, O death - from that road defending this man, we make ''bráhman'' a covering (''varman'') for him.
8.2.11 I make for thee breath-and-expiration, old age as [mode of] death, long life-time, welfare; all the messengers of Yama, sent forth by Vivasvant's son, moving about, I drive away.
8.2.12 Afar niggardliness, perdition, away seizure (''grā́hi''), the flesh-eating ''piçācás'', every demon that is of evil nature - that we smite away, as it were into darkness.
8.2.13 Thy breath I win from immortal Agni, from long-lived Jātavedas, that thou mayest take no harm, mayest be immortal in alliance [with him]: that I make for thee; let that prove successful for thee.
8.2.14 Let heaven-and-earth be propitious to thee, not distressing, conferring fortune (? ''abhiçrī́''); let the sun burn weal unto thee; let the wind blow weal to thy heart; let the heavenly waters, rich in fatness (''páyas''), flow propitious upon thee.
8.2.15 Propitious to thee be the herbs; I have caught thee up from the lower unto the upper earth; there let both the Ādityas, sun and moon, defend thee.
8.2.16 What enveloping (''paridhā́na'') garment thou hast, what inner wrap (''nīví'') thou makest for thyself, that we make propitious unto thy body; be it not harsh to thy touch.
8.2.17 In that with a dangerous (? ''marcáyant'') very sharp (''sutejás'') razor thou, a hair-dresser, shearest hair and beard, adorning the face, do not thou steal away our life-time.
8.2.18 Propitious to thee be rice and barley, free from ''balā́sa'', causing no burning (?); these drive off the ''yákṣma;'' these free from distress.
8.2.19 What thou eatest (''aç''), what thou drinkest, of grain, milk of the plowing - what should be eaten, what should not be eaten - all food I make for thee poisonless.
8.2.20 Both to day and to night, to them both we commit thee. Defend ye this man for me from the ''arā́yas'' that seek to devour [him].
8.2.21 A hundred, a myriad years, two periods (''yugá''), three, four, we make for thee; let Indra-and-Agni, let all the gods, approve thee, not showing enmity.
8.2.22 Unto autumn, unto winter, unto spring, unto summer, we commit thee; [be] the rains pleasant to thee, in which the herbs grow.
8.2.23 Death is master of bipeds; death is master of quadrupeds; from that death, lord of kine, I bear thee up; so do thou not be afraid.
8.2.24 Thou, unharmed one, shalt not die; thou shalt not die, be not afraid; [men] die not there, nor go to lowest darkness.
8.2.25 Every one, verily, lives there - ox, horse, man, beast - where this charm (''bráhman'') is performed, a defense (''paridhí'') unto living.
8.2.26 Let it protect thee from thy fellows, from witchcraft, from thy kinsmen; be thou undying, immortal, surviving; let not thy life-breaths (''ásu'') leave thy body.
8.2.27 The deaths that are a hundred and one, the perditions (''nāṣṭrā́'') that are to be over-passed - from that let the gods free thee, from Agni Vāiçvānara.
8.2.28 Agni's body art thou, successful (''pārayiṣṇú''); demon-slayer art thou, rival-slayer, likewise expeller of disease, a remedy ''pūtúdru'' by name.
;;; 3 To Agni: against sorcerers and demons.
8.3.1 I pour ghee upon (''a-ghṛ'') the vigorous (''vājín'') demon-slayer; I go for broadest protection to the friend; Agni, sharpened, [is] kindled with acts of skill (? ''krátu''); let him by day, let him by night, protect us from harm.
8.3.2 Do thou, of iron tusks, O Jātavedas, kindled, touch the sorcerers with thy flame (''arcís''); take hold of the false-worshipers with thy tongue; cutting off (?) the flesh-eaters, shut them in thy mouth.
8.3.3 Apply both thy tusks, thou that hast them in both jaws (''ubhayāvín''), the lower one and the upper, being harmful, sharpened; also in the atmosphere go about, O Agni; put together thy grinders upon the sorcerers.
8.3.4 O Agni, split the skin of the sorcerer; let the harmful thunderbolt smite him with flame (''háras''); crush his joints, O Jātavedas; let the flesh-eating, flesh-craving one divide him.
8.3.5 Wherever now, O Jātavedas, thou seest a sorcerer standing, O Agni, or also moving, also flying in the atmosphere, him [as] archer, pierce with a shaft, being sharpened.
8.3.6 By sacrifices, O Agni, straightening (''sam-nam'') thine arrows, by speech smearing their tips with thunderbolts - with them pierce in the heart the sorcerers; break back (''pratīcás'') their arms.
8.3.7 Both those that are seized do thou win (''spṛ''), O Jātavedas, and also the sorcerers that have seized with spears; do thou, O Agni, first, greatly gleaming, smite [him] down; let the variegated raw-flesh-eating ''kṣvín̄kās'' eat him.
8.3.8 Proclaim thou here which that [is], O Agni - the sorcerer that is doing this; him take hold of with the fuel, O youngest [god]; subject him to the eye of the men-watcher.
8.3.9 With sharp eye, O Agni, defend thou the sacrifice; conduct it forward to the Vasus, O forethoughtful one; thee that art harmful, greatly gleaming against the demons, let not the sorcerers injure, O men-watcher.
8.3.10 A men-watcher, do thou look around for the demon among the people (''vikṣú''); crush back his three points (''ágra''); crush, O Agni, his ribs with flame (''háras''); cut up threefold the root of the sorcerer.
8.3.11 Let the sorcerer thrice come within thy reach (? ''prásiti''), who, O Agni, slays truth (''ṛtá'') with untruth; roaring [at] him with thy flame (''arcís''), O Jātavedas, do thou put him down (''ni-yuj'') before the eyes of the singer.
8.3.12 What, O Agni, the pair utter in curses today, what harshness (''tṛṣṭá'') of speech the reciters (''rebhá'') produce: the shaft that is born of fury of the mind - with that pierce thou the sorcerers in the heart.
8.3.13 Crush away the sorcerers with heat; crush away, O Agni, the demon with flame (''háras''); crush away with burning (''arcís'') the false-worshipers; crush away the greatly gleaming ones that feed on lives (? ''asutṛ́p'').
8.3.14 Let the gods crush away today the wicked one (''vṛjiná''); let [his] curses sent forth go back upon him; let shafts strike (''ṛch'') in the vitals him who steals by [magic] speech; let the sorcerer come within every one's reach.
8.3.15 The sorcerer that smears himself (''sam-añj'') with the flesh of men, who with that of horses, with cattle, who bears [off] the milk of the inviolable [cow], O Agni - their heads cut thou into with flame.
8.3.16 Let the sorcerers bear [off] poison of the kine; let them of evil courses fall under the wrath of Aditi; let god Savitar abandon them; let them lose their share of the herbs.
8.3.17 Yearly [is] the milk of the ruddy [cow]; of that let not the sorcerer partake (''aç''), O men-watcher; whatever one [of them], O Agni, would fain enjoy (''tṛp'') the beestings, him do thou pierce back in the vitals with thy burning (''arcís'').
8.3.18 From of old, O Agni, thou killest the sorcerers; the demons have not conquered thee in fights; burn up the flesh-eaters together with their dupes (? ''mūrá''); let them not be freed from thy heavenly missile.
8.3.19 Do thou, O Agni, from below, from above, do thou defend us from behind and from in front; let those [flames] of thine, unaging, extremely hot, greatly paining, burn against the evil-plotter.
8.3.20 From behind, in front, below, and above, do thou, O Agni, a poet, protect us about with poesy; [as] friend a friend, [as] unaging in order to old age, [as] an immortal mortals, do thou [protect] us, O Agni.
8.3.21 Set thou in the reciter, O Agni, that eye with which thou seest the hoof-breaking sorcerers; Atharvan-like, with brightness of the gods, scorch (''uṣ'') down the truth-damaging fool (''acít'').
8.3.22 Thee the devout, O Agni, powerful one, would we fain put about us [as] a stronghold, [thee] of daring color, day by day, slayer of the destructive one.
8.3.23 With poison smite thou back the destructive ones, the demoniacs, O Agni, with keen brightness (''çocís''), with heat-pointed flames (''arcí'').
8.3.24 With great light Agni shineth out; he maketh all things manifest by his greatness; he forceth away the ill-conditioned ungodly wiles; he sharpeneth his two horns to gore the demons.
8.3.25 The two horns that thou hast, O Jātavedas, unaging, of keen thrust, sharpened by devotion (''bráhman'') - with them do thou gore, O Jātavedas, the attacking enemy (''durhā́rd''), the advancing ''kimīdín'' with thy flame (''arcís'').
8.3.26 Agni drives off the demons, he of bright brightness, immortal, bright, purifying, laudable.
;;; 4 Against sorcerers and demons: to Indra and Soma.
8.4.1 O Indra-and-Soma, burn the demon, oppress (''ubj'') [him]; put (''arpay-'') down, ye two bulls, them that thrive in darkness; crush away, scorch down the fools (''acít''); slay, push, pin (''çā'') down the devourers.
8.4.2 O Indra-and-Soma, against ''abhí'' the evil-plotter, the evil, let heat boil all up ''sam-yas'' like a fiery pot; assign unavoidable hate unto the brahman-hating, flesh-eating ''kimīdín'' of terrible aspect.
8.4.3 O Indra-and-Soma, pierce ye the evil-doers within their hiding-place (''vavrá''), in untenable darkness, whence there shall not come up again any one soever of them; be that your furious might unto overpowering.
8.4.4 O Indra-and-Soma, cause to roll (''vṛt'') from the sky the deadly weapon, from the earth also, a shattering for the evil-plotter; shape out from the mountains (''párvata'') the noisy one, wherewith ye burn down the increasing demon.
8.4.5 O Indra-and-Soma, cause [it] to roll forth from the sky; with fireheated, stone-smiting, unaging heat-weapons do ye pierce the devourers in the abyss; let them go to silence.
8.4.6 O Indra-and-Soma, be there about you on all sides this prayer (''matí''), as a girth [about] two vigorous (''vājín'') horses, the invocation (''hótrā'') that I send forth to you with wisdom; these acts of worship (''bráhman'') quicken ye like two lords of men.
8.4.7 Remember ye with [your] rapid courses; smite the haters, the destructive demoniacs; O Indra-and-Soma, let there not be ease (''sugá'') for the evil-doer, the hater that at any time vexes me.
8.4.8 Whoever reviles with untrue speeches me walking with simple mind - like waters grasped with the fist, let the speaker of what is not be [himself] non-existent, O Indra.
8.4.9 They who distract (''vi-hṛ'') with [their] courses him of simple intent, or who spoil at their will (''svadhā́bhis'') what is excellent - let Soma either deliver them up to the serpent, or let him set them in the lap of perdition.
8.4.10 Whoever, O Agni, tries to harm our taste of drink, of horses, of kine, whoever of our bodies - let the enemy, the thief, the theft-committer, go to want (''dabhrá''); let him be degraded with self and with posterity.
8.4.11 Be he far away, with self and with posterity, be he beneath all the three earths, let his glory dry up, ye gods, who by day and who by night tries to harm me.
8.4.12 It is easy of understanding for a knowing man (''jána'') [that] true and untrue words (''vácas'') are at variance; of them what is true, whichever is more right, that Soma verily favors; he smites the untrue.
8.4.13 Soma by no means furthers the wicked [man], nor the ''kshatríya'' who maintains [anything] falsely; he smites the demon; he smites the speaker of untruth; both lie within reach of Indra.
8.4.14 If I am one of false gods, or if I put upon (? ''api-ūh'') the gods what is vain, O Agni - why art thou angry with us, O Jātavedas? let them of hateful speech obtain (''sac'') misery of thee.
8.4.15 May I die today if I am a sorcerer, or if I have burnt (''tap'') a man's lifetime; then let him be divided from ten heroes who vainly says to me "thou sorcerer."
8.4.16 Whoever to me that am no sorcerer (''áyātu'') says "thou sorcerer," or whatever demoniac says "I am pure (''çúci'')" - let Indra smite him with a great deadly weapon; may he fall lowest of every creature.
8.4.17 She who goes forth in the night like an owl (?), hateful, hiding herself away - may she fall down into an endless hole (''vavrá''); let the [pressing-] stones smite the demoniacs with [their] noises.
8.4.18 Scatter yourselves, O Maruts, among the people (''vikṣú''); seek, seize, crush (''sam-piṣ'') the demoniacs, who, becoming birds, fly in the nights, or who have put defilements (''rípas'') on the heavenly sacrifice.
8.4.19 Cause the stone to roll forth from the sky, O Indra; [it,] sharpened by Soma, do thou wholly sharpen, O liberal one; from before, from away, from below, from above, do thou smite upon the demoniacs with a mountain.
8.4.20 Here fly these dog-sorcerers (''çváyātu''); Indra the unharmable they the harm-seeking seek to harm; the mighty one (''çakrá'') sharpens his deadly weapon for the treacherous ones (''píçuna''); now may he let fly (''sṛj'') the thunderbolt at the sorcerers (''yātumánt'').
8.4.21 Indra was the crusher-away of the familiar demons (''yātú''), of the oblation-disturbers, of them who strive to win upon [it]; let the mighty one (''çakrá'') attack them that are demoniacs as an ax the woods, splitting [them] like vessels.
8.4.22 The owl-sorcerer, the owlet-(?)sorcerer smite thou, the dog-sorcerer and the cuckoo-sorcerer, the eagle-(? ''suparṇá'')sorcerer and the vulture-sorcerer - do thou destroy (''pra-mṛṇ'') the demon, O Indra, as if with a mill-stone.
8.4.23 Let not the sorcerous demon reach us; let the ''kimīdíns'' that are paired fade away; let the earth protect us from earthly distress, let the atmosphere protect us from heavenly.
8.4.24 O Indra, smite the man sorcerer, likewise the woman who is prevailing with magic (''māyā́''); let the neckless false-worshipers vanish (? ''ṛd''); let them not see the sun moving upward.
8.4.25 Look thou on; look abroad; O Soma, Indra also, watch ye; hurl ye the deadly weapon at the demons, the thunderbolt at the sorcerers (''yātumánt'').
;;; 5 Against witchcraft etc.: with an amulet.
8.5.1 This reverting amulet, a hero, is bound on a hero; heroic, rival-slaying, true hero, a very propitious protection.
8.5.2 This amulet, rival-slaying, having excellent heroes, powerful, vigorous, overpowering, formidable, a hero, goes to meet the witchcrafts, spoiling [them].
8.5.3 With this amulet Indra smote Vritra; with this he, being filled with wisdom, ruined the Asuras; with this he conquered both, heaven-and-earth here; with this he conquered the four directions.
8.5.4 This amulet of ''sraktyá'', back-turning, reverting, forcible, remover of scorners, controlling - let it protect us on all sides.
8.5.5 This Agni says, this also Soma says, this Brihaspati, Savitar, Indra; let these gods, my representatives (''puróhita''), drive the witchcrafts backward with the reverters.
8.5.6 I interpose heaven-and-earth, also the day, also the sun; let these gods, my representatives, drive the witchcrafts backward with the reverters.
8.5.7 The people who make the amulet of ''sraktyá'' their defenses - like the sun ascending the sky, it, controlling, drives away the witchcrafts.
8.5.8 By the amulet of ''sraktyá'', as by a seer (''ṛ́ṣi'') full of wisdom, I have conquered all fighters; I smite away the scorners, the demoniacs.
8.5.9 The witchcrafts that are of the An̄girases, the witchcrafts that are of the Asuras, the witchcrafts that are self-made, and those that are brought by others - let these, of both kinds, go away to the distances, across ninety navigable [streams].
8.5.10 On this man let the gods bind the amulet [as] defense: [namely,] Indra, Vishṇu, Savitar, Rudra, Agni, Prajāpati, Parameshṭhin, Virāj, Vāiçvānara, and all_ the seers.
8.5.11 Thou art the chief (''uttamá'') of herbs, as the ox of moving creatures (''jágat''), as the tiger of wild beasts (''çvápad''); whom we sought, him have we found, a watcher near at hand (?).
8.5.12 He verily becomes a tiger, likewise a lion, likewise a bull, likewise a lessener of rivals, who bears this amulet.
8.5.13 Not Apsarases smite him, not Gandharvas, not mortals; he reigns over (''vi-rāj'') all the quarters who bears this amulet.
8.5.14 Kaçyapa created thee; Kaçyapa collected thee; Indra bore thee in human wise (?); bearing [thee], he conquered in the conflict (?); the amulet, of thousand-fold might, the gods made their defense.
8.5.15 Whoever with witchcrafts, whoever with consecrations, whoever with sacrifices desires to slay thee - him do thou, O Indra, smite back with the hundred-jointed thunderbolt.
8.5.16 Let this back-turning, forcible, all-conquering amulet verily defend [our] progeny and riches, a very propitious protection.
8.5.17 Freedom from rivals for us below, freedom from rivals for us above, freedom from rivals for us behind, O Indra, light in front make thou, O hero.
8.5.18 A defense for me [be] heaven-and-earth, a defense the day, a defense the sun, a defense for me both Indra and Agni; a defense let Dhātar assign (''dhā'') to me.
8.5.19 Indra-and-Agni's abundant formidable defense, which not all the gods together pierce through - let that, being great, save my body on all sides, that I may be long-lived, attaining old age.
8.5.20 The divine amulet hath ascended me, in order to great unharmedness; enter ye together unto this post (? ''methí''), body-protecting, thrice-defending, in order to vigor (''ójas'').
8.5.21 In this let Indra deposit manliness; this, O gods, enter ye together unto, in order to long life-time of a hundred autumns; that he may be long-lived, attaining old age.
8.5.22 Giver of welfare, lord of the people, Vritra-slayer, masterful remover of scorners, let Indra bind for thee the amulet, [he] that has conquered, is unconquered, soma-drinking, fearless-making bull; let him defend thee on all sides, by day and by night on all sides.

8.6.1 The two spouse-finders which thy mother rubbed up for thee when born (fem.) - for them ''tátra'' let not the ill-named one be greedy, the ''aliṅça'' nor the ''vatsápa'' (calf-drinker ''or'' -protector?).
8.6.2 ''Palāla'' (straw) and ''anupalāla'' (after-straw), ''çárku, kóka'' (cuckoo), ''malimlucá'' (robber), ''palī́jaka'', the entwiner (''āçréṣa''), the wrap-garmented, the bear-necked, the winking one.
8.6.3 Approach (''saṁ-vṛt'') thou not; creep thou not on; creep not down between the thighs; I make for her a remedy, the ''bajá'', expeller of the ill-named.
8.6.4 Both the ill-named and the well-named - both seek approach (''saṁvṛ́t''); the niggards (''arā́ya'') we smite away; let the well-named seek what is woman's (''strāíṇa'').
8.6.5 The ''ásura'' that is black, hairy, tuft-born, also snouted (''túṇḍika'') - the niggards we smite away from her pudenda, from her buttocks (''bhánsas'').

8.6.11 The ''kukúndhas'', the ''kukū́rabhas'', that bear skins (''kṛ́tti''), pelts (? ''dūrçá''), dancing on like impotent men, that make a noise in the forest - them we make disappear from here.
8.6.12 They who do not endure yonder sun, burning down from the sky, the niggards, buck-clothed, ill-smelling, red-mouthed, the ''mákakas'', we make to disappear.
8.6.13 They who, putting their excessive self on the shoulder, carry [it], thrusters-forth of women's hips - O Indra, make the demons disappear.
8.6.14 They who go before a woman, bearing horns (pl.) in the hand, stayers in the oven, laughing out, who make light in the tuft - them we make to disappear from here.
8.6.15 Of whom the front-feet are behind, the heels in front, the faces in front, who are threshing-floor-born, dung-smoke-born, who are ''úruṇḍas'' and ''maṭmaṭás'', pot-testicled, ''ayāçús'' (impotent ?) - these from her, O Brahmaṇaspati, do thou make to disappear by attention (? ''pratībodhá'').
8.6.16 With eyes cast about, not looking forward (? ''ápracan̄kaça''), womenless be the eunuchs; make to fall down, O remedy, him who, not her husband, tries to approach this woman that has a husband.
8.6.17 The bristling, hermit-haired, grinding up, much handling one, hastening up, copper-colored, snouted (? ''tuṇḍéla'') and ''çáluḍa'', pierce thou forth with the foot, with the heel, as a kicking cow a pot.
8.6.18 Whoever shall handle thy embryo, or shall make it born dead - let the brown one, with formidable bow, make him pierced to the heart.
8.6.19 They who suddenly make die those that are born, [who] lie by the bearing [women] - the Gandharvas, woman-seekers (?), let the brown one drive, as the wind a cloud.
8.6.20 Let [her] maintain what is left (?); what is set, let not that fall down; let the two formidable remedies, to be borne in the under garment, defend thine embryo.
8.6.21 From the rim-nosed, the ''tan̄galvà'', the shady (? ''chā́yaka'') and naked, from the ''kimīdín'', let the brown one protect thee about for progeny, for husband.
8.6.22 From the two-mouthed, the four-eyed, the five-footed, the fingerless one, from the much twining twiner (''vṛ́nta'') that creeps forth upon [one], do thou protect [her] about.
8.6.23 They who eat raw meat, and who the flesh of men, the hairy ones [that] devour embryos - them we make to disappear from here.
8.6.24 They that creep away from the sun, as a daughter-in-law away from her father-in-law - let both ''bajá'' and ''pin̄gá'' pierce in into their heart.
8.6.25 ''Pin̄gá'', defend thou [the child] in process of birth; let them not make the male female; let not the egg-eaters injure the embryos; drive thou the ''kimīdíns'' from here.
8.6.26 Childlessness, still-birth, also crying, guilt (''aghá''), barrenness (? ''āvayá'') - that do thou attach to [our] enemy (''ápriya''), as if having made a garland from a tree.
;;; 7 To the plants: for some one's restoration to health.
8.7.1 Those that are brown, and that are bright (çukrá), the red and the spotted, the swarthy, the black herbs - all [of them] do we address (''acka-ā-vad'').
8.7.2 Let them save (''trā'') this man from the ''yákṣma'' sent by the gods - the plants of which heaven has been the father, earth the mother, ocean the root.
8.7.3 Waters [were] the beginning, heavenly herbs; they have made disappear from every limb thy sinful (''enasyà'') ''yákṣma''.
8.7.4 The spreading, the bushy, the one-spathed, the extending herbs do I address; those rich in shoots, jointed (''kāṇḍín''), that have spreading branches (''víçākha''); I call for thee the plants that belong to all the gods, formidable, giving life to men.
8.7.5 What power [is] yours, ye powerful ones, [what] heroism and what strength [is] yours, therewith, O herbs, free ye this man from this ''yákṣma;'' now (''átho'') do I make a remedy.
8.7.6 The lively, by-no-means-harming, living herb, the non-obstructing, up-guiding, flourishing (? ''puṣyá'') one, rich in sweets, do I call hither, for this man's freedom from harm.
8.7.7 Let the forethoughtful ones come hither, allies (''medín'') of my spell (''vácas''), that we may make this man pass forth out of difficulty.
8.7.8 Food of fire, embryo of the waters, they that grow up renewed, fixed, thousand-named - be they remedial [when] brought.
8.7.9 Wrapped in ''ávakā'', water-natured, let the herbs, sharp-horned, thrust away difficulty.
8.7.10 Releasing, free from Varuṇa, formidable, that are poison-spoiling, also ''balā́sa''-dispelling, and that are witchcraft-spoiling - let those herbs come hither.
8.7.11 Let the purchased, very powerful plants that are praised save in this village cow, horse, man, beast.
8.7.12 Rich in sweets the root, rich in sweets the tip of them, rich in sweets was the middle of the plants; rich in sweets the leaf, rich in sweets the flower of them; partaking of sweet, a drink of nectar (''amṛ́ta''), let them milk out ghee, food, with milk (''gó-'') as chief (''-purogavá'').
8.7.13 However many [may be] these herbs upon the earth, let them, thousand-leafed, free me from death, from distress.
8.7.14 Let the tigerish amulet of plants, saving, protecting from imprecation, smite far away from us diseases [and] all demons.
8.7.15 As at the roaring of a lion do they quake; as at fire do they tremble at [the herbs when] brought; let the ''yákṣma'' of kine, of men, go driven by the plants beyond navigable streams.
8.7.16 The herbs, becoming freed from Agni Vāiçvānara - go ye stretching over the earth, [ye] whose king is the forest-tree.
8.7.17 They who, belonging to the An̄girases, grow on mountains and on plains - let those herbs, rich in milk, propitious, be weal to our heart.
8.7.18 Both what plants I know, and what I see with the eye, the unknown and what we are acquainted with, and those in which we know what is brought together -
8.7.19 Let all the entire herbs note (''budh'') my spell (''vácas''), that we may make this man pass forth out of difficulty.
8.7.20 The ''açvatthá'', the ''darbhá'', ''sóma'' king of plants, immortal oblation - rice and barley [are] remedial, immortal sons of heaven.
8.7.21 Ye rise up (''ud-hā''); it thunders, it roars at [you], O herbs! when, O ye children of the spotted one, Parjanya favors you with seed.
8.7.22 Of this ''amṛ́ta'' we make this man to drink the strength; now do I make a remedy, that he may be one of a hundred years (''-hāyaná'').
8.7.23 The boar knows the plant; the mongoos knows the remedial [herb]; what ones the serpents, the Gandharvas know, those I call to aid for him.
8.7.24 What [herbs] of the An̄girases the eagles [know], what heavenly ones the ''ragháṭs'' know, what ones the birds, the swans know, and what all the winged ones, what herbs the wild beasts know - those I call to aid for him.
8.7.25 Of how many herbs the inviolable kine partake (''pra-āç''), of how many the goats and sheep, let so many herbs, being brought, extend protection to thee.
8.7.26 In how many herbs human physicians (''bhiṣáj'') know a remedy, so many, all-remedial, do I bring unto thee.
8.7.27 Rich in flowers, rich in shoots (''prasū́-''), rich in fruits, also those lacking fruits - like joint mothers, let them milk unto this man in order to his freedom from harm.
8.7.28 I have taken thee up out of what has five ''çalas'', and also out of what has ten ''çalas'', also out of Yama's fetter, out of all offense against the gods.
;;; 8 To conquer enemies.
8.8.1 Let Indra the shaker shake (''math'') [them], he the mighty hero, stronghold-splitter, in order that we may slay by thousands the armies of our enemies.
8.8.2 Let the putrid rope, breathing on [it], make yonder army putrid; seeing afar smoke, fire, let our enemies set fear in their hearts.
8.8.3 Crush yonder men out, O ''açvattá;'' devour (''khād'') them speedily, O ''khadirá;'' let them be suddenly ''tājád'' broken ''bhāñj'' like hemp ''bhán̄ga''; let the slayer (''vádhaka'') slay (''han'') them with deadly weapons (''vadhá'').
8.8.4 Let the rough-called one make yonder men rough (''paruṣá''); let the slayer slay them with deadly weapons; let them be broken quickly like a reed (''çará''), tied together with a great net.
8.8.5 The atmosphere was the net; the great quarters [were] the net-stakes; therewith encircling [them], the mighty one (''çakrá'') scattered away the army of the barbarians (''dásyu'').
8.8.6 Since great [is] the net of the great mighty one, the vigorous (''vājínīvant'') - therewith do thou crowd (''ubj'') down upon all [our] foes, that no one soever of them may be released.
8.8.7 Great, O Indra, hero (''çū́ra''), is the net of thee that art great, that art worth a thousand, that hast hundred-fold heroism; therewith encircling the army of the barbarians, the mighty one slew a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred million.
8.8.8 This great world was the net of the great mighty one; by that net of Indra do I encircle all yon men with darkness.
8.8.9 Debility, formidable ill-success, and mishap that is not to be exorcised away (''an-apavācaná''), toil, and weariness, and confusion - with these do I encircle all yon men.
8.8.10 To death do I deliver those yonder; with fetters of death [are] they bound (''sā''); the sad messengers that are death's - them I lead them to meet, having bound (''bandh'') [them].
8.8.11 Lead ye them, O messengers of death; O messengers of Yama, restrain (''apa-umbh'') [them]; be they slain to more than thousands; let Bhava's club (? ''matyà'') shatter them.
8.8.12 The Perfectibles (''sādhyá'') go lifting with force one net-stake, the Rudras one, the Vasus one; by the Ādityas one is lifted.
8.8.13 Let all the gods from above go crowding with force; let the An̄girases go slaying midway the great army.
8.8.14 The forest trees, them of the forest trees, the herbs and the plants, what is biped, what is quadruped I despatch (''iṣ''), that they may slay yonder army.
8.8.15 The Gandharvas and Apsarases, the serpents, the gods, the pure-folks, the Fathers, those seen, those unseen I despatch, that they may slay yonder army.
8.8.16 Here are spread the fetters of death, which stepping into thou art not released; let this horn (''kū́ṭa'') slay of yonder army by thousands.
8.8.17 The hot drink (''gharmá'') [is] kindled with fire, this thousand-slaying oblation (''hóma''); both Bhava and the spotted-armed one - O Çarva, slay ye (two) yonder army.
8.8.18 Let them go unto death's burning (?), unto hunger, debility, the deadly weapon, fear; by snare (''ákṣu'') and net, O Çarva, [do thou] and Indra slay yonder army.
8.8.19 Flee (''tras'') forth, O enemies, being conquered; run, being thrust by the charm (''bráhman''); of them yonder, thrust forth by Brihaspati, let none soever be freed.
8.8.20 Let their weapons (''ā́yudha'') fall down; let them not be able to fit the arrow; then, of them fearing much let arrows strike in the vitals.
8.8.21 Together let heaven-and-earth yell at them; together let the atmosphere, along with the deities; let them not find a knower, nor a foundation; mutually destroying one another let them go unto death.
8.8.22 The four quarters [are] the she-mules of the god-chariot; the sacrificial cakes [are] the hoofs, the atmosphere the seat (? ''uddhí''), heaven-and-earth the two sides, the seasons the reins, the intermediate directions the attendants, speech the rim (? ''párirathya'').
8.8.23 The year (''saṁvatsará'') is the chariot, the complete year (''parivatsará'') the chariot-lap, ''virā́j'' the pole (''īṣá''), Agni the chariot-mouth, Indra the left-stander, the moon the charioteer.
8.8.24 On this side conquer thou; on this side conquer away, conquer completely, conquer; hail! let these here conquer, let those yonder be conquered; hail ''svā́hā'' to these! wail (''duráhā'') to those! with the blue-red one I stretch down upon them yonder.
;;; 9 Mystic: extolling the virā́j.
8.9.1 Whence [were] those two born? which side (''árdha'') was that? out of what world? out of which earth? the two young (''vatsá'') of the ''virā́j'' rose out of the sea (''salilá''); of those I ask thee: by whether [of them was] she milked?
8.9.2 He who caused the sea to resound (''krand'') with greatness, making a threefold lair (''yóni'') as he lay, the desire-milking young of the ''virā́j;'' he made his bodies secret (''gúhā'') in the distance.
8.9.3 What three great ones (''bṛhát'', n.) there are, the fourth of which [one] disjoins [as] speech - the priest (''brahmán'') may know it by penance, the inspired one, in which one (''ékam'') is joined, in which one [is joined].
8.9.4 Forth out of ''bṛhát'' [as] sixth five sāmans [were] fashioned; ''bṛhát'' was fashioned out of ''bṛhatī́;'' out of what was ''bṛhatī́'' made?
8.9.5 ''Bṛhatī́'' the measure (''mā́trā'') was fashioned forth out of measure [as] a mother; illusion (''māyā́'') was born from illusion, Mātalī out of illusion.
8.9.6 Vāiçvānara's counterpart [is] the sky above, as far as Agni forced (''bādh'') apart the two firmaments; from that sixth yonder come the ''sómas''; up from here they go unto the sixth of the day.
8.9.7 We these six seers ask thee, O Kaçyapa, for thou didst join what is joined and what is to be joined; they call (''ah'') ''virā́j'' the father of the ''bráhman;'' distribute (? ''vi-dhā'') it to us [thy] friends according to [our] numbers.
8.9.8 After whom, when removed, the sacrifices remove (''pra-cyu''), [whom], when attending, they attend on (''upa-sthā''), in whose course (''vratá'') and? impulse the monster (? ''yakṣá'') stirs - that, O seers, is the ''virā́j'' in the highest firmament.
8.9.9 Breathless, she goes by the breath of breathing ones (f.); ''virā́j'' goes unto ''svarā́j'' from behind; ''virā́j'' that touches, that is adapted to, everything - some see her, some see her not.
8.9.10 Who understandeth (''pra-vid'') the pair-ness of ''virā́j?'' who the seasons, who the ordering (''kálpa'') of her? who her steps (''kráma''), how many times milked out (''vi-duh'')? who her abode (''dhā́man''), how many times dawnings (''vyùṣṭi'')?
8.9.11 This same is she that first shone forth; among these other ones (f.) she goes about having entered; great mightinesses [are] within her; the woman, the new-going generatrix, hath conquered.
8.9.12 The two meter-winged dawns, greatly adorning themselves, move on together toward the same lair (''yóni''); spouses of the sun, they move on together, understanding, having ensigns, unaging, having abundant seed.
8.9.13 Three (f.) have come along the road of righteousness; three heats (''gharmá'') have come after the seed; one (f.) enlivens the progeny, one the refreshment (''ū́rj''); one defends the realm of the godly ones.
8.9.14 She that was fourth set Agni-and-Soma; the seers arranging the (two) wings of the sacrifice - ''gāyatrī́, triṣṭúbh, jágatī, anuṣṭúbh, bṛhadarkī́'', bringing heaven (''svàr'') for the sacrificer.
8.9.15 Five milkings after five dawnings; five seasons after the five-named cow; five quarters arranged by the fifteenth - those (f.) [are] one-headed toward one world.
8.9.16 Six [are] born the beings first-born of righteousness; six ''sā́mans'' carry the six-day (?) [sacrifice]; after the six-yoked plough (''sī́ra'') severally a ''sā́man;'' six they call (''ah'') the heavens and earths, six the wide [spaces].
8.9.17 Six they call the cold, and six the hot months; tell ye us the season, which one [is] in excess (''átirikta''); seven eagles (''suparṇá''), poets, sat down; seven meters after seven consecrations.
8.9.18 Seven [are] the offerings (''hóma''), the fuels seven, the sweet things (''mádhu'', n.) seven, the seasons seven; seven sacrificial butters (''ā́jya'') went about the existent thing (''bhūtá''); those (f .) are seven-vultured, so have we heard.
8.9.19 Seven [are] the meters increasing (''-úttara'') by four, the one set upon the other: how do the praises (''stóma'') stand firm in them? how are they set in the praises?
8.9.20 How did gāyatrī permeate (''vi-āp'') the triple [''stóma'']? how is ''triṣṭúbh'' adapted to that of fifteen? how ''jāgatī'' to that of thirty-three? how [is] ''anuṣṭúbh'' that of twenty-one?
8.9.21 Eight [are] born the beings first-born of righteousness; eight, O Indra, are the priests (''ṛtvíj'') who are of the gods; Aditi has eight wombs (''yóni''), eight sons; the oblation (''havyám'') goes unto the eighth night.
8.9.22 Thus thinking what is better have I come hither; in your friendship I am auspicious (''çéva''); being of the same birth, your skill is propitious; it (m.), understanding, goes about to you all (f.).
8.9.23 Eight of Indra, six of Yama, seven of the seers, seven-fold; waters, men (''manuṣyà''), herbs - them five followed (''sac'') after.
8.9.24 Since the heifer milked solely (''kévalī'') for Indra [his] will (''váça''), the beestings, [when] first milked, then [she] gratified in four ways the four - gods, men, Asuras, and seers.
8.9.25 What now [is] the ox (''gó''), who the sole seer, what the abode (''dhā́man''), what the blessings (''āçís'')? the monster on the earth [is] simple (''ekavṛ́t''); the sole season - which now is that?
8.9.26 One [is] the ox, one the sole seer, one the abode, singly the blessings; the monster on the earth [is] single; the sole season is not in excess.
;;; 10 Extolling the virā́j.
8.10.1 ''Virā́j'' verily was this [universe] in the beginning; of her when born everything was afraid, [thinking] "this one indeed will become this [universe]."
8.10.2 She ascended (''ut-kram''); she descended (''ni-kram'') in the householder's fire (''gā́rhapatya''); house-sacrificing (''gṛhamedhín'') house-holder ''gṛhápati'' becometh he who knoweth thus.
8.10.3 She ascended; she descended in the fire of offering (''āhavanī́ya''): to his god-invocation the gods go, dear to the gods becometh he who knoweth thus.
8.10.4 She ascended; she descended in the southern ''dákṣiṇa'' fire: justified (? ''-ṛtá'') by the offering, fit for sacrificial gifts ''dakṣiṇī́ya'', fit for refuge (''vā́sateya'') becometh he who knoweth thus.
8.10.5 She ascended; she descended in the assembly (''sabhā́''): [men] go to his assembly, fit for the assembly becometh he who knoweth thus.
8.10.6 She ascended; she descended in the gathering (''sámiti''): [men] go to his gathering, fit for gatherings becometh he who knoweth thus.
8.10.7 She ascended; she descended in address (? ''āmántraṇa''); [men] go to his address, fit for address becometh he who knoweth thus.
8.10.8 She ascended; she stood striding (? ''víkrāntā'') fourfold in the atmosphere.
8.10.9 Of her gods and men said: "she verily knoweth that upon which we of both classes may subsist; let us call to her."
8.10.10 They called to her:
8.10.11 "O refreshment, come! O ''svadhā́'', come! O pleasantness, come! O thou rich in cheer (''írā''), come!"
8.10.12 Of her Indra was the young (''vatsá''), ''gāyatrī́'' the halter, cloud the udder;
8.10.13 Both ''bṛhát'' and ''rathantará'' were two teats; both ''yajñāyajñíya'' and ''vāmadevyá'' [were] two.
8.10.14 Herbs did the gods milk [from her] by ''rathantará'', expansion (''vyácas'') by ''bṛhát;''
8.10.15 Waters by ''vāmadevyá'', the sacrifice by ''yajñāyajñíya''.

8.10.33 Poison is poured out after the unfriendly foe of him who knoweth thus.
;;; 1 To the honey-whip etc.
9.1.1 Verily from sky, from earth, from atmosphere, from ocean, from fire, from wind was born the honey-whip; noting (''cāy'') it, [as] putting on immortality, all creatures (''prajā́'') rejoice to meet it with their hearts.
9.1.2 Great, all-formed [is] the milk of it; also they call thee the seed of ocean; whence the granting honey-whip cometh, thither breath, thither immortality (''amṛ́ta'') hath entered in.
9.1.3 Men, manifoldly meditating (''mimāṅs-'') severally see its movement (''caritá'') on the earth; verily from fire, from wind was born the honey-whip, the formidable daughter (''naptí'') of the Maruts.
9.1.4 Mother of the Ādityas, daughter of the Vasus, breath of creatures (''prajā́''), navel of immortality (''amṛ́ta''), gold-colored, dripping with ghee (''ghṛtā́cī''), the honey-whip moves among mortals [as] a great brightness (bhárga).
9.1.5 The gods generated the whip of honey; of it there came to be an all-formed embryo; this, when born [and] tender, its mother fills; it, [when] born, looks abroad on all existences.
9.1.6 Who knows (''pra-vid'') that, who understands (''cit'') that which [is] the unexhausted soma-holding vessel of the heart of it? The priest (''brahmán'') of excellent wisdom - he may revel in it.
9.1.7 He knows those two, he understands them that [are] its two unexhausted, thousand-streaming breasts; they milk out refreshment (''ū́rj''), unresisting.
9.1.8 She that, crying much, great, vigor-bestowing, loud-noised, goes unto her course (? ''vratá''), bellowing at three ''gharmás'' - she lows a lowing, she abounds (''pī'') with milk (''páyas'').
9.1.9 Whom, when fattened, the waters wait upon, the mighty (''çākvará'') bulls that are self-ruling, they rain, they cause to rain, for him who knows this, his desire, refreshment, waters.
9.1.10 Thunder [is] thy voice, O Prajāpati; a bull, thou castest (''kṣip'') vehemence (? ''çúṣma'') over the earth; verily from fire, from wind was born the honey-whip, the formidable daughter of the Maruts.
9.1.11 As at the early pressing soma is loved (''priyá'') of the Açvins, so, O Açvins, let splendor be maintained in my self.
9.1.12 As at the second pressing soma is loved of Indra-and-Agni, so, O Indra-and-Agni, let splendor be maintained in my self.
9.1.13 As at the third pressing soma is loved of the Ṛibhus, so, O Ṛibhus, let splendor be maintained in my self.
9.1.14 May I generate honey; may I win honey; rich in milk, O Agni, have I come; unite me here with splendor.
9.1.15 Unite me, O Agni, with splendor, with progeny, with life-time; may the gods know me as such; may Indra know, together with the seers.
9.1.16 As the honey-makers bring together honey upon honey, so, O Açvins, let splendor be maintained in my self.
9.1.17 As the flies (''mákṣā'') smear down here honey upon honey, so, O Açvins, let my splendor, brilliancy, strength, and force be maintained.
9.1.18 What honey on hills (''girí''), on mountains, what in kine, in horses, in strong drink (''súrā'') as poured out, what honey [is] there, [be] that in me.
9.1.19 O ye Açvins, lords of beauty! anoint me with the honey of bees (''sāraghá''), that I may speak splendid words among the people.
9.1.20 Thunder [is] thy voice, O Prajāpati; a bull, thou castest vehemence on the earth, on the sky; upon that live all cattle; with this it lavishes (''pṛ'') food (''íṣ'') [and] refreshment.
9.1.21 Earth [is] the staff, atmosphere the embryo, sky the whip, lightning the snapper (? ''prakaçá''), of gold the globule (''bindú'').
9.1.22 He who knows the seven honeys of the whip becomes rich in honey: the Brahman, and the king, and the milch-cow, and the draft-ox, and rice, and barley; honey the seventh.
9.1.23 Rich in honey he becomes; rich in honey becomes his provision (''āhāryà''); worlds rich in honey he conquers, who knows thus.
9.1.24 When it thunders in a clear sky, that is Prajāpati himself becoming manifest to his creatures; therefore I stand with the sacred cord over the right shoulder, saying: O Prajāpati, take notice (''anu-budh'') of me: creatures [take notice], Prajāpati takes notice of him who knows thus.
;;; 2 To Kāma: for various blessings.
9.2.1 The rival-slaying bull Kāma do I desire to aid (? ''çikṣ'') with ghee, with oblation, with sacrificial butter; do thou, praised with great heroism, make my rivals to fall downward.
9.2.2 What of my mind or my sight is not agreeable (''priyá''), what of me gnaws, does not enjoy (''abhi-nand''), that evil-dreaming do I fasten on my rival; praising Kāma, may I shoot up.
9.2.3 Evil-dreaming, O Kāma, and difficulty, O Kāma, want of progeny, homelessness, ruin do thou, formidable, masterful, fasten on him who shall seek to devise (''cikits-'') distresses for us.
9.2.4 Thrust, O Kāma; thrust forth, O Kāma; let them who are my rivals go to ruin; of them, thrust to lowest darknesses, do thou, O Agni, burn out the abodes (''vā́stu'').
9.2.5 That daughter of thine, O Kāma, is called a milch-cow, what utterance (''vā́c'') the poets name ''virā́j;'' with that do thou avoid them that are my rivals; let breath, cattle, life avoid them.
9.2.6 With the strength of Kāma, of Indra, of king Varuṇa, of Vishṇu, with the impulse of Savitar ('the impeller'), with the priestship (''hotrá'') of Agni I thrust forth my rivals, as a skilful pole-man (? ''çambín'') a boat on the waters (''udaká'').
9.2.7 Let Kāma, my valiant (''vājín'') formidable overseer, make for me freedom from rivals; let the all-gods be my refuge; let all the gods come to this call of mine.
9.2.8 Enjoying this sacrificial butter rich in ghee, do ye, with Kāma as chief (''-jyéṣṭha''), revel here, making for me freedom from rivals.
9.2.9 Becoming, O Kāma, in alliance (''sarátham'') with Indra-and-Agni, may ye make my rivals to fall downward; of them, fallen to lowest darknesses, do thou, O Agni, burn along out the abodes.
9.2.10 Slay thou, O Kāma, those that are my rivals; make them fall down to blind darknesses; be they all senseless (? ''nírindriya''), sapless; let them not live any day soever.
9.2.11 Kāma hath slain (''vadh'') them that are my rivals; he hath made for me wide space, prosperity; let the four directions bow to me; let the six wide ones fem. bring ghee to me.
9.2.12 Let them float away downward, like a boat severed from its mooring; of them, thrust forth by missiles, there is no return again.
9.2.13 Agni [is] a repeller (? ''yava''), Indra a repeller, Soma a repeller; let the repelling (? ''yavayā́van'') gods repel (''yu'') him.
9.2.14 With his heroes not safe ''á-sarvavīra'' let him go on, thrust forth, to be hated of friends, to be avoided of his own kin; on earth also stay (''ava-sā'') thunderbolts; may the formidable god massacre your rivals.
9.2.15 This great [earth], both stirred and unstirred, bears the lightning and all the thunders; let the Āditya, arising with property, with brilliancy, thrust downward my rivals, he the powerful one.
9.2.16 What sufficient (''udbhú'') triply-guarding defense thou hast, O Kāma, worship (''bráhman'') as extended protection (''várman''), made unpierceable, with that do thou avoid them that are my rivals; let breath, cattle, life avoid them.
9.2.18 Wherewith the gods thrust forth the Asuras, wherewith Indra conducted the barbarians (''dásyu'') to lowest darkness, therewith do thou, O Kāma, thrust forth far from this world those who are my rivals.
9.2.18 As the gods thrust forth the Asuras, as Indra drove (''bādh'') the barbarians to lowest darkness, so do thou, O Kāma, thrust forth far from this world those who are my rivals.
9.2.19 Kāma was first born; not the gods, the Fathers, nor mortals attained (''āp'') him; to them art thou superior (''jyā́yāṅs''), always great; to thee as such, O Kāma, do I pay homage.
9.2.20 How great in width are heaven-and-earth; how far the waters flowed, how far fire - to them art thou etc. etc.
9.2.21 How great are the divergent (''víṣvañc'') quarters [and] directions; how great the regions (''ā́çā''), on-lookers of the sky - to them art thou etc. etc.

9.2.23 Superior art thou to him that winks, that stands; superior to the ocean art thou, O Kāma, fury - to them art thou etc. etc.
9.2.24 Verily no wind soever attains (''āp'') Kāma, not fire, sun, also not moon; to them art thou etc. etc.
9.2.25 What propitious excellent bodies thou hast, O Kāma, with which what thou choosest becometh real, with them do thou enter wholly into us; make evil devices (''dhī́'') enter away elsewhere.
;;; 3 To accompany the releasing of a house.
9.3.1 Of the props (''upamít''), of the supports (''pratimít''), and also of the connectors (? ''parimít'') of the dwelling (''çā́lā'') that possesses all choice things, we unfasten the tied (''naddhá'') [parts].
9.3.2 What of thee is tied, O thou that possessest all choice things, what fetter and knot is made, that with a spell (''vā́c'') I make fall apart, as Brihaspati [did] Bala.
9.3.3 He stretched (''ā-yam''), he combined (''sam-bṛh''), he made thy knots firm (''dṛḍhá''); with Indra we unfasten [them], as a knowing slaughterer the joints.
9.3.4 Of thy beams (''vaṅçá''), ties (''náhana''), and binding (''prāṇāhá'') grass, of thy sides (''pakṣá''), O thou that possessest all choice things, we unfasten the tied [parts].
9.3.5 Of the clamps (''saṁdaṅçá''), of the ''paladás'', and of the embracer (''páriṣvañjalya'') - now of the mistress of the building do we unfasten the tied [parts].
9.3.6 What hanging vessels (? ''çikyà'') they bound on to thee within for enjoyment, those we unfasten for thee; be thou, [when] set up, O mistress of the building, propitious to our self (''tanū́'').
9.3.7 Oblation-holder (''havirdhā́na''), fire-place (''agniçā́la''), wives' site [and] seat; seat of the gods art thou, O heavenly dwelling.
9.3.8 The thousand-eyed net (''ákṣu''), stretched out as ''opaçá'' on the division-line (''viṣūvánt''), tied down, put on, do we with worship (''bráhman'') unfasten.
9.3.9 He who, O dwelling, accepts thee, and he by whom thou art built - let both those, O mistress of the building, live to attain old age.
9.3.10 Do thou, made firm, tied, adorned (''pari-kṛ''), go to him yonder - thou whose every limb, whose every joint we unfasten.
9.3.11 He who fixed (''ni-mi'') thee, O dwelling, [who] brought together the forest trees - unto progeny, O dwelling, he, [as a] most exalted Prajāpati, made thee.
9.3.12 Homage to him, homage to the giver, and to the lord of the dwelling we pay; homage to the forth-moving (''pra-car'') fire, and to thy spirit (? ''púruṣa'') [be] homage.
9.3.13 Homage to kine, to horses, whatever is born (''vi-jā'') in the dwelling; thou rich in births (''vijā-''), rich in progeny, we unfasten thy fetters.
9.3.14 Thou coverest within the fire, the men together with the cattle (''paçú''); thou rich in births, rich in progeny, we unfasten thy fetters.
9.3.15 Between both heaven and earth what expanse [there is], therewith do I accept this dwelling of thine; the atmosphere that pervades (''vimā́na'') space (''rájas''), that do I make a paunch (''udára'') for treasures; therewith I accept the house for this man.
9.3.16 Rich in refreshment, rich in milk, fixed (''ni-mi''), built upon the earth, bearing all food, O dwelling, do not thou injure those accepting [thee].
9.3.17 Wrapped (''ā-vṛ'') with grass, clothing itself in ''paladás'', the dwelling, place of rest (''nivéçanī'') of living creatures, like the night - built on the earth thou standest, like a she-elephant, having feet.
9.3.18 Of thy rush-work (''íṭa'') I unfasten what was tied on, uncovering; [thee] pressed together by Varuṇa let Mitra in the morning open out.
9.3.19 The dwelling fixed with worship (''bráhman''), fixed, built by the poets - let Indra-and-Agni, immortal, defend the dwelling, the seat for soma (''somyá'').
9.3.20 A nest (''kulā́ya'') upon a nest, a vessel (''kóça'') pressed together in a vessel - there a mortal is born (''vi-jā''), from whom all is generated (''pra-jā'').
9.3.21 [The dwelling] which is fixed with two sides, with four sides, which with six sides - the eight-sided, the ten-sided dwelling, the mistress of the building, Agni lies in like an embryo.
9.3.22 I go forward, O dwelling, turned toward thee, uninjuring, that art turned toward me; for within [are] fire and waters, the first door of right (''ṛtá'').
9.3.23 I bring forward these waters, free from ''yákṣma'', dispellers of ''yákṣma''; I set forth unto the houses, together with immortal fire.
9.3.24 Fasten thou not on us the fetter; a heavy burden, become thou light; like a woman (''vadhū́''), O dwelling, we carry thee where we will.

;;; 4 Accompanying the gift of a bull.
9.4.1 The bright bull of a thousand, rich in milk, bearing all forms in his bellies, desiring to accomplish (? ''çikṣ'') what is excellent for his giver, the sacrificer - he, the ruddy one of Brihaspati, hath stretched ''ā-tan'' the line (''tántu'').
9.4.2 He who in the beginning became the counterpart (pratimā́) of the waters, prevailing (''prabhū́'') for everything, like the divine earth, father of young (''vatsá''), lord of the inviolable [kine] - let him set (''kṛ'') us in thousandfold prosperity.
9.4.3 A male (''púmāṅs''), [yet] pregnant, big (''sthávira''), rich in milk, the bull bears a trunk (''kábandha'') of good (''vásu''); him, sacrificed to Indra, let Agni Jātavedas carry by the roads traveled by the gods.
9.4.4 Father of calves, lord of the inviolable [kine], also father of great gulfs (''gárgara''); calf, afterbirth, fresh milk, beestings, curd, ghee - that [is] his seed.
9.4.5 The gods' portion [was] that load, the sap of waters, of plants, of ghee; the mighty one (''çakrá'') chose a drink of soma; a great stone became what [was his] body.
9.4.6 Thou bearest a vessel filled with soma, shaper (''tvástṛ'') of forms, generator of cattle; propitious to thee be these pudenda (? ''prajanū́'') that are here; to us, O ax, confirm those that are yonder.
9.4.7 Sacrificial butter he bears; ghee [is] his seed; thousandfold prosperity - that they call the sacrifice; the bull, clothing himself in Indra's form - let him, O gods, come propitious to us, being given.
9.4.8 Indra's force, Varuṇa's two arms, the Açvins' two shoulders, of the Maruts this hump; they who are wise, poets, who are skilful (''manīṣín''), call him Brihaspati brought together.
9.4.9 Rich in milk, thou stretchest unto the people (''víç'') of the gods; thee they call Indra, thee Sarasvant; he gives a thousand [kine] with one face who makes offering (''ā-hu'') of a bull to a Brahman.
9.4.10 Brihaspati, Savitar bestowed on thee vigor (''váyas''); from Tvashṭar, from Vāyu was brought forth thy soul (''ātmán''); with mind in the atmosphere I make offering (''hu'') of thee; let heaven-and-earth both be thy ''barhís''.
9.4.11 He who goes speaking out greatly among the kine, like Indra among the gods - of that bull let the worshiper (''brahmán'') praise together the members excellently.
9.4.12 His sides were Anumati's; his flanks (? ''anūvṛ́j'') were Bhaga's; of his knees (''aṣṭhīvánt'') Mitra said: those are wholly mine.
9.4.13 His rump was the Ādityas'; his two thighs were Brihaspati's; his tail [was] the heavenly wind's; therewith he shakes the herbs.
9.4.15 His intestines (''gúdā'') were Sinīvālī's; they called his skin Sūryā's; they called his feet (pl.) the upstander's (''utthātṛ́''), when they prepared (''kalpay-'') the bull.
9.4.15 His breast (''kroḍá'') was Jāmiçaṅsa's; his vessel [was] maintained as Soma's, when all the gods, coming together, distributed (''vi-kalpay-'') the bull.
9.4.16 Those dew-claws (''kúṣṭhikā'') [were] Saramā's; they assigned the hoofs to the tortoises (''kūrmá''); the content of his bowels they maintained for the worms, the ''çavartás''.
9.4.17 With his horns he pushes the demon; with his eye he slays ruin; with his ears he hears what is excellent - he who is the inviolable lord of kine.
9.4.18 With a hundred-fold sacrifice he sacrifices; the fires burn him not; all the gods quicken him, who makes offering of a bull to a Brahman.
9.4.19 Having given a bull to Brahmans, one makes his mind wider; he beholds (''ava-paç'') prosperity of the inviolable [kine] in his own stall.
9.4.20 Let there be kine, let there be progeny, also let there be own strength; let the gods approve all that for the giver of a bull.
9.4.21 Let this burly (''pípāna'') one, a very Indra, bestow conspicuous wealth; let this one [bestow] a well-milking cow, constantly with calf; let him yield (''duh'') inspired will beyond the sky.
9.4.22 Of reddish form, clouded (? ''nabhasá''), vigor-giving, vehemence of Indra, all-formed, he hath come to us, assigning to us life-time and progeny; and with abundances of wealth let him attach himself to (''abhi-sac'') us.
9.4.23 Here in this stall, O closeness (''upapárcana''), be thou close unto us; unto [us] what seed the bull has; unto [us], O Indra, thy heroism.
9.4.24 This young male we set toward you here; with him go ye (fem.) playing according to your wills; abandon us not with birth, ye wellportioned ones; and with abundances of wealth attach yourselves to us.
;;; 5 With the offering of a goat and five rice-dishes.
9.5.1 Conduct him hither; take hold; let him go, foreknowing, unto the world of the well-doing; crossing the great darknesses variously, let the goat step unto the third firmament (''nā́ka'').
9.5.2 I lead thee about as portion for Indra, as patron (''sūrí'') for the sacrificer at this sacrifice; whoever hate us, them take hold after; innocent (''ánāgas'') [are] the sacrificer's heroes.
9.5.3 Away from his foot wash thou down the evil walk that he walked (''car''); with cleansed hoofs let him step on, foreknowing; crossing the darknesses, variously looking abroad let the goat step unto the third firmament.
9.5.4 Cut along this skin with the dark [metal], O slaughterer, joint by joint with the knife (''así''); do not plot against [him]; do not be hostile to [him]; prepare him joint-wise; set him up apart in the third firmament.
9.5.5 With a verse I set the kettle upon the fire; pour thou on the water; set him down; set [him] about with fire, ye quellers; when cooked, let him go where is the world of the well-doing.
9.5.6 Step up from here, if thou hast been completely heated, from the heated pot on to the third firmament; thou, a fire, hast come into being out of fire; conquer [thy way] unto that world of light.
9.5.7 The goat [is] Agni, and they call the goat light; they say that the goat is to be given by one living to a priest (''brahmán''); the goat, given in this world by one having faith, smites far away the darknesses.
9.5.8 Having five rice-dishes, let him step out five-fold, about to step unto the three lights; go thou forth to the midst of the well-doing that have made offerings; spread out (''vi-çri'') upon the third firmament.
9.5.9 Ascend, O goat, to where is the world of the well-doing; like an expelled ''çarabhá'' mayest thou move (''eṣ'') across difficult places; given, with five rice-dishes, to a priest (''brahmán''), he shall rejoice the giver with rejoicing.
9.5.10 The goat sets him that has given it on the three-firmamented, three-heavened, three-backed back of the firmament; being given with five rice-dishes to a priest, thou art a single milch-cow, all-formed, wish-yielding.
9.5.11 This third light of yours, O Fathers, the goat with five rice-dishes one gives to a priest; the goat, given in this world by one having faith, smites far away the darknesses.
9.5.12 Desiring to obtain the world of the well-doing that have made offerings, one gives to a priest a goat with five rice-dishes; do thou conquer complete attainment (''vyā̀pti'') unto that world; be he, accepted, propitious to us.
9.5.13 The goat verily was born from the heat of the fire, wise, of the wise (''vípra''), of power, he the inspired one; what is offered, is bestowed, is conferred (''abhípūrta''), accompanied with ''váṣaṭ'' - that let the gods prepare in due season (''rtuçás'').
9.5.14 A home-woven garment he may give, also gold as sacrificial gift; so he fully obtains the worlds that are heavenly and that are earthly.
9.5.15 Unto thee, O goat, let these streams of soma (''somyá'') go, divine, ghee-backed, honey-dripping; establish thou earth and sky, upon the seven-rayed back of the firmament.
9.5.16 A goat art thou; O goat, heaven-going (''svar-gá'') art thou; by thee the An̄girases foreknew [their] world; that pure (''púṇya'') world would I fain foreknow.
9.5.17 Wherewith thou carriest a thousand; wherewith, O Agni, [the offering of] one's whole possession - therewith carry thou this our offering to go to heaven (''svàr'') among the gods.
9.5.18 The cooked goat, having five rice-dishes, driving off perdition, sets [one] in the heavenly (''svargá'') world; with it may we conquer worlds that possess suns.
9.5.19 [The goat] which one deposited with the Brahman, and which among the people (''vikṣú''); what scattered drops (''viprúṣ'') [there are] of the rice-dishes, of the goat - all that of ours, O Agni, do thou later know in the world of the well-done, at the meeting of the ways.
9.5.20 The goat verily strode out here (''idám'') in the beginning; this [earth] became its breast, the sky its back, the atmosphere its middle, the quarters its (two) sides, the (two) oceans its paunches;
9.5.21 Both truth and right its eyes, all truth [and] faith its breath, the ''virā́j'' its head; this verily is an unlimited offering, namely (''yát'') the goat with five rice-dishes.
9.5.22 An unlimited offering does he obtain, an unlimited world does he take possession of (''ava-rudh''), who gives a goat with five rice-dishes, with the light of sacrificial gifts.
9.5.23 He should not split its bones; he should not suck out its marrow; taking it all together, he should cause it to enter here and here.
9.5.24 This and this verily becomes its form; therewith one makes it come together; food, greatness, refreshment it yields (''duh'') to him who gives a goat with five rice-dishes, with the light of sacrificial gifts.
9.5.25 Five gold ornaments (''rukmá''), five new garments, five milch-cows milking his desire come to be his who gives a goat with etc. etc.
9.5.26 Five gold ornaments become light for him; his garments become a defense for his body, he attains the heavenly (''svargá'') world, who gives a goat with etc. etc.
9.5.27 Whoever (fem.) having gained a former husband, then gains another later one - if (''ca'') they (dual) shall give a goat with five rice-dishes, they shall not be separated.
9.5.28 Her later husband comes to have the same world with his remarried spouse who (masc.) gives a goat with five rice-dishes, with the light of sacrificial gifts.
9.5.29 A milch-cow having one calf after another, a draft-ox, a pillow, a garment, gold, having given, those go to the highest heaven (''dív'').
9.5.30 Self, father, son, grandson, grandfather, wife, generatrix, mother, those who are dear - them I call upon.
9.5.31 Whoever knows the season "torrid" (''nāídāgha'') by name - that verily is the season "torrid" by name, namely (''yát'') the goat with five rice-dishes; he indeed burns out the fortune of his unfriendly foe (''bhrā́tṛvya''), he thrives (''bhū'') by himself, who gives a goat with five rice-dishes, with the light of sacrificial gifts.
9.5.32 Whoever knows the season "making" by name, each making fortune of his unfriendly foe he takes to himself; that verily is the season "making" by name, namely the goat with five rice-dishes; he indeed etc. etc.
9.5.33 Whoever knows the season "gathering" by name, each gathering fortune of his unfriendly foe he takes to himself; that verily is the season "gathering" by name, namely the goat etc. etc.

9.5.37 Cook ye the goat and the five rice-dishes; let all the quarters, like-minded, united (''sadhryàñc''), with the intermediate directions, accept that of thee.
9.5.38 Let them defend this of thine for thee; to them I offer (''hu'') sacrificial butter, this oblation.
;;; 6 Exalting the entertainment of guests.
9.6.1 Whoever may know the obvious (''pratyákṣa'') ''bráhman'', whose joints are the preparations (''sambhārá''), whose spine the verses (''ṛ́c'');
9.6.2 Whose hairs the chants (''sā́man''), [whose] heart the sacrificial formula (''yájus'') is called, [whose] litter (''paristáraṇa'') the oblation.
9.6.3 When in truth the lord of guests meets with his eyes the guests, he looks at a sacrificing to the gods.
9.6.4 When he greets them, he enters upon consecration; when he offers (''yāc'') water, he brings forward the [sacrificial] waters.
9.6.5 Just what waters are brought in at the sacrifice, those are the very ones.
9.6.6 When they fetch a gratification (''tárpaṇa'') - that is just the same as an animal for Agni-and-Soma that is bound [for sacrifice].
9.6.7 In that they prepare lodgings, they so prepare the seat (''sádas'') and oblation-holders (''havirdhā́na'').
9.6.8 In that they strew [a couch], that is a ''barhís''.
9.6.9 In that they fetch a coverlet (? ''upariçayaná''), thereby one gains possession of the heavenly (''svargá'') world.
9.6.10 In that they fetch mattress and pillow, those are the enclosures (''paridhí'').
9.6.11 In that they fetch ointment and unguent, that is sacrificial butter.
9.6.12 In that they fetch a morsel (''khādá'') before the serving-up (''pariveṣá''), that is the two sacrificial cakes.
9.6.13 In that they call the food-maker (''açanakṛ́t''), they so call the maker of oblations.
9.6.14 The grains of rice, of barley, that are scattered out - those are soma-shoots (''aṅçú'').
9.6.15 The mortar and pestles - those are the pressing-stones.
9.6.16 The sieve ''çū́rpa'' is the soma-strainer (''pavítra''); the chaff is the pomace (''ṛjīṣā́''); the waters are those of pressing.
9.6.17 The spoon is the sacrificial spoon, the stirring-stick the spit (? ''nékṣaṇa''), the kettles the wooden vessels, the drinking-vessels those of Vāyu, this [earth] itself the black antelope's skin.
9.6.18 The lord of guests verily makes for himself a sacrificer's ''brā́hmaṇa'' in that he looks at the [portions] to be partaken of, saying "is this larger, or this?"
9.6.19 In that he says "take up the larger one," he thereby makes his breath longer (''várṣīyāṅs'').
9.6.20 [In that] he presents [it], he brings libations near.
9.6.21 Of them, brought near, the guest makes libations in himself;
9.6.22 With his hand as sacrificial spoon, at his breath as stake, with the sound of swallowing as utterance of ''váṣaṭ''.
9.6.23 These same guests, both loved (''priyá'') and unloved, [as] priests (''ṛtvíj''), make [one] go to the heavenly world.
9.6.24 He who, knowing thus, shall partake, not hating, he shall not partake the food of one hating, not of one that is doubted, nor of one doubting (?).
9.6.25 Verily every such one has his sin devoured, whose food they partake of.
9.6.26 Verily every such one has his sin undevoured whose food they partake not of.
9.6.27 Verily he who presents [the food] hath always his pressing-stones harnessed, his cleanser wet, his sacrifice extended, his ceremony of offering assumed.
9.6.28 To Prajāpati, verily, is his offering extended who presents.
9.6.29 He who presents verily strides Prajāpati's strides after [him].
9.6.30 [The fire] that is the guests', that is the fire of libations (''āhavanī́ya''); the one in the dwelling (''véçman''), that is the householder's fire (''gā́rhapatya''); the one in which they cook, that is the southern fire (''dakṣiṇāgní'').
9.6.31 Verily both what is sacrificed and what is bestowed of the houses doth he partake of who partakes before a guest.
9.6.32 Verily both the milk and the sap of the houses doth he etc. etc.
9.6.33 Verily both the refreshment and the fatness of the houses doth he etc. etc.
9.6.34 Verily both the progeny and the cattle of the houses doth he etc. etc.
9.6.35 Verily both the fame and the glory of the houses doth he etc. etc.
9.6.36 Verily both the fortune (''çrī́'') and the alliance (? ''saṁvíd'') of the houses doth he etc. etc.
9.6.37 He verily is a guest, namely (''yát'') one versed in sacred learning (''çrótriya''); before him one should not partake.
9.6.38 When the guest hath partaken he should partake, in order to the soulfulness of the sacrifice, in order to the integrity of the sacrifice; that is the [proper] course.
9.6.39 That verily is specially sweet which comes from the cow (''adhigavá''), either milk (''kṣīrá'') or flesh; that he should not partake of.
9.6.40 He who, thus knowing, pouring out milk, presents [it] - as much as, having sacrificed with a very successful ''agniṣṭomá'', one gets possession of, of so much thereby does he get possession.
9.6.41 He who, thus knowing, pouring out butter (''sarpís''), presents [it] - as much as, having sacrificed with a very successful ''atirātrá'', one gets etc. etc.
9.6.42 He who, thus knowing, pouring out honey, offers [it] - as much as, having sacrificed with a very successful session-sitting, one gets etc. etc.
9.6.43 He who, thus knowing, pouring out meat, presents [it] - as much as, having sacrificed with a very successful twelve-day sacrifice, one gets etc. etc.
9.6.44 He who, thus knowing, pouring out water, presents [it] - he arrives at (''gam'') firm standing in order to the generating of progeny; he becomes loved of progeny - he who, thus knowing, pouring out water, presents [it].
9.6.45 For him the dawn utters ''hing;'' Savitar preludes (''pra-stu''); Brihaspati with refreshment (''ūrjáyā'') sings the ''udgīthá;'' Tvashṭar with prosperity responds (''prati-hṛ''); all the gods [are] the conclusion (''nidhána''); the conclusion of thrift, of progeny, of cattle becometh he who knoweth thus.
9.6.46 For him the rising sun utters ''hing;'' cow-gathering time (''saṁgavá'') preludes; noon sings the ''udgīthá;'' afternoon responds; the setting [sun is] the conclusion: the conclusion of etc. etc.
9.6.47 For him the cloud, forming (''bhū''), utters ''hing;'' thundering, it preludes; lightenng, it responds; raining, it sings the ''udgīthá;'' holding up, it is the conclusion: the conclusion of etc. etc.
9.6.48 [When] he meets the guests with his eyes, he utters hing; [when] he greets [them], he preludes; [when] he offers water, he sings the ''udgīthá;'' [when] he presents [food], he responds; the remnant (''úchiṣṭa'') [of the food] is the conclusion: the conclusion of etc. etc.
9.6.49 When (''yát'') he calls the distributor, then he is just summoning (''ā-çrāvay-'').
9.6.50 When [the distributor] assents, then he is just answering the summons.
9.6.51 When the servers, with drinking-vessels in their hands, both the former and the latter, go forward, they are just cup-bearing priests.
9.6.52 Of them, none soever is not an invoker (''áhotṛ'').
9.6.53 Verily when the lord of guests goes up unto the houses serving the guests, then he is even going down unto the purifactory bath (''avabhṛ́tha'').
9.6.54 When he apportions [them], he is apportioning sacrificial fees; when he follows [them], then he is even shifting the place of sacrifice (''ud-ava-sā'').
9.6.55 He the guest?, being invited (''úpahūta''), feeds (''bhakṣay-'') on the earth; in him locative, invited nominative, [he the host? feeds on] what of every form [there is] on the earth.
9.6.56 He, being invited, feeds in the atmosphere; in him, invited, [he feeds on] what of every form [there is] in the atmosphere.
9.6.57 He, being invited, feeds in the sky (''dív''); in him, invited, [he feeds on] what of every form [there is] in the sky.
9.6.58 He, being invited, feeds among the gods; in him, invited, [he feeds on] what of every form [there is] among the gods.
9.6.58 He, being invited, feeds in the worlds; in him, invited, [he feeds on] what of every form [there is] in the worlds.

9.9.1 Of this pleasant (''vāmá'') hoary invoker - of him the brother is the midmost stone (? ''áçna''); his third brother [is] ghee-backed; there I saw the lord of the people who hath seven sons.
9.9.2 Seven harness (''yuj'') a one-wheeled chariot; one horse, having seven names, draws (''vah'') [it]; of three naves [is] the wheel, unwasting, unassailed, whereon stand all these existences.
9.9.3 The seven that stand on this chariot - seven horses draw it, seven-wheeled; seven sisters shout at [it] together, where are set down the seven names of the kine.
9.9.4 Who saw it first in process of birth, as the boneless one bears (''bhṛ'') him that has bones? where forsooth the earth's life (''ásu''), blood, soul? who shall go to ask that of him who knows?
9.9.5 Let him who truly knows here tell (''brū'') the set-down track of this pleasant bird; the kine extract (''duh'') milk from his head; clothing themselves in a wrap, they have drunk water with the foot.
9.9.6 Simple, not discerning (''vi-jñā'') with the mind, I ask about the thus set-down tracks of the gods; over the yearling (? ''baṣkáya'') calf have the poets stretched out seven lines (''tántu'') for weaving.
9.9.7 I, not understanding (''cit''), ask here the understanding poets, I unknowing (''vid''), them that know; he who propped asunder these six spaces (''rájas''), in the form of the goat (? ''ajá'') - was that also alone?
9.9.8 The mother portioned the father in righteousness, for with meditation (''dhītí''), with mind, came together in the beginning she, repugnant, womb-sapped, pierced; paying homage, verily, they went unto encouragement.
9.9.9 The mother was yoked to the pole of the sacrificial gift; the embryo stood among the wiles (? ''vṛjanī́''); the calf bleated, looked after the cow of all forms, in the three distances (''yójana'').
9.9.10 The one, bearing three mothers [and] three fathers, stood upright; verily they do not exhaust him; on the back of yon sky the all-knowing ones talk a speech not found by all.
9.9.11 On the five-spoked circumvolving wheel on which stood all existences - its axle, much-burdened, is not heated; even from of old it is not severed with the nave.
9.9.12 The five-footed father, of twelve shapes (''-ā́kṛti''), they call rich in ground (''purīṣín'') in the far (''pára'') half of the sky; then these others call [him] set (''árpita'') in the lower outlook that is seven-wheeled, six-spoked.
9.9.13 The twelve-spoked wheel - for that is not to be worn out - revolves greatly about the sky of righteousness; there, O Agni, stood the sons, paired, seven hundred and twenty.
9.9.14 The unwasting wheel, with rim, rolls about; ten harnessed ones draw upon the outstretched one (fem.); the sun's eye goes surrounded with the welkin (''rájas''), in which stood all existences.
9.9.15 Them, being women, they declared (''ah'') to me to be men; he who hath eyes may see, [but] the blind will not distinguish (''vi-cit''); the son that is a poet, he verily understood (''ā-cit''); whoever knows those things apart, he shall be [his] father's father.
9.9.16 Of those born together the seventh they call sole-born; six, they say, are twins, god-born seers; the sacrifices (? ''iṣṭá'') of them, distributed according to their abodes, quake in their station, being altered (''vi-kṛ'') in respect to form.
9.9.17 Below the distant (''pára''), thus beyond the lower, bearing (''bhṛ'') her calf with her foot, the cow hath stood up; whitherwards, to what quarter (''árdha'') hath she forsooth gone away? where giveth she birth? for [it is] not in this herd.
9.9.18 Below the distant whoever knows his father, below the distant, thus beyond the lower - who, playing the poet, shall proclaim [him] here? from whence [is] heavenly mind produced?
9.9.19 Them that are hitherward they call off-ward; them, again, that are off-ward they call hitherward; what things, O Soma, thou and Indra have done, those they draw, harnessed as it were with the pole of the welkin.
9.9.20 Two eagles (''suparṇá''), joint companions, embrace the same tree; of them the one eats the sweet berry; the other looks on all the time, not partaking.
9.9.21 On what tree the honey-eating eagles all settle and give birth - what they call the sweet berry in the top of it, that cannot he attain who knoweth not [his] father.
9.9.22 Where the eagles, with counsel (''vidátha''), sound incessantly (''ánimeṣam'') unto the draught of ''amṛ́ta'', - thus the shepherd of all existence, he the wise one entered there into me that am simple.

9.10.1 That the ''gāyatrī́''-verse is set (''ā-dhā'') in the ''gāyatrī́''-verse, or that they fashioned the ''triṣṭúbh''-verse out of the ''triṣṭúbh''-verse, or that the ''jágatī'' step is set in the ''jágatī'' (''jágat'') - whoever know that, they have attained immortality.
9.10.2 By the ''gāyatrī́''-verse he measures off the song (arká), by the song the chant (''sā́man''), by the ''triṣṭúbh''-vevse the hymn (''vāká''), by the hymn of two feet [or] of four feet the hymn; by the syllable they measure the seven tunes (''vā́ṇi'').
9.10.3 By the ''jágatī'' he established (''skabh'') the river in the sky; in the ''rathaṁtará'' he beheld (''pari-paç'') the sun; they call the three kindlers (''samídh'') the ''gāyatrī́''-verse's; it was superior to them by bulk, by greatness.
9.10.4 I invite that well-milking milch-cow; a skilful-handed milker also shall milk her; may the impeller impel us the best impulse; the hot drink is kindled about: that may he kindly proclaim.
9.10.5 Lowing, mistress of good things, seeking her calf with her mind, hath she come unto [it]; let this inviolable one yield milk for the Açvins; let her increase unto great good-fortune.
9.10.6 The cow lowed toward the winking calf; she uttered ''hing'' at [its] head, in order to lowing; bellowing the mouth (? ''sṛ́kvan'') unto the hot drink, she lows a lowing, she abounds with milk.
9.10.7 This one here twangs, by whom the cow is surrounded; she lows a lowing, being set (''çritá'') on the sparkler (''dhvasáni''); since she put down mortals by her thoughts (''cittí''), becoming the lightning, she threw (''ūh'') back the wrap.
9.10.8 Breathing lies the swift moving thing, living, stirring, fixed, in the midst of the abodes (''pastyā̀''); the living one moves at the will (? ''svadhā́bhis'') of the dead one; the immortal one [is] of like source with the mortal.
9.10.9 The shaker-apart (? ''vidhú'') that runs on the back of the sea, being young, the hoary one swallowed; see thou the poesy of the heavenly one with greatness; today he died, yesterday he received breath (''sam-an'').
9.10.10 He who made him knows not of him; [he is] verily out of sight now of him who saw him; he, enveloped within his mother's womb, with his much progeny, entered into perdition (''nírṛti'').
9.10.11 I saw the shepherd, not lying down, moving both hither and thither upon his roads; he, clothing himself in the collecting, he in the dispersing ones, rolls greatly on among existences.
9.10.12 The heaven our father, generator, navel here; this great earth our connection, mother; the womb (''yóni'') within the (two) outstretched cups (''camū́''); here the father hath set (''ā-dhā'') the daughter's embryo.
9.10.13 I ask of thee the extreme (''pára'') end of the earth; I ask the seed of the male (''vṛ́ṣan'') horse; I ask the navel of all existence; I ask the highest (''paramá'') firmament (''vyòman'') of speech.
9.10.14 This sacrificial hearth is the extreme end of the earth; this soma is the seed of the male horse; this sacrifice is the navel of all existence; this priest (''brahmán'') is the highest firmament of speech.
9.10.15 I do not distinguish what this is that I am; I go secret, fastened together with mind; when the first-born of righteousness hath come to me, then indeed I attain a share of this speech.
9.10.16 Offward, forward goes, seized by ''svadhā́'', the immortal one, of like source with the mortal; the two, constantly going separate apart - the one they noted, the other they noted not.
9.10.17 Seven half-embryos, the seed of existence, stand in front (? ''pradíçā''), in Vishṇu's distribution; they, by thoughts (''dhītí''), by mind, they, inspired, surround on all sides the surrounders.
9.10.18 In the syllable of the verse (''ṛ́c'') in the highest firmament, on which all the gods sat down: he who knoweth not that, what will he do with the verse? they who know that sit together yonder.
9.10.19 Shaping (''kalpay-'') with measure the step of the verse, they shaped by the half-verse all that stirs; the ''bráhman'' of three feet, many-formed, spread out (''vi-sthā''); by that do the four quarters live.
9.10.20 Mayest thou be well-portioned, feeding in excellent meadows; so also may we be well-portioned; eat thou grass, O inviolable one, at all times; drink clear water, moving hither.
9.10.21 The cow verily lowed, fashioning the seas; one-footed, two-footed [is] she, four-footed; having become eight-footed, nine-footed, thousand-syllabled, a series (''pan̄tí'') of existence; out from her flow apart the oceans.
9.10.22 Black the descent, the yellow eagles, clothing themselves in waters, fly up to the sky; they have come hither from the seat of righteousness; then, forsooth, with ghee they deluged the earth.
9.10.23 She that is footless goes first of them (fem.) that have feet: who understood (''ā-cit'') that of you, O Mitra and Varuṇa? the embryo brings (''ā-bhṛ'') the burden of her; she (?) fills (? ''pṛ'') truth, protects (''ni-pā'') untruth.
9.10.24 ''Virā́j'' [is] speech, ''virā́j'' earth, ''virā́j'' atmosphere, ''virā́j'' Prajāpati; ''virā́j'' became death, the over-king of the perfectibles (''sādhyá''); in his control are what was, what is to be; let him put in my control what was, what is to be.
9.10.25 The dung-made smoke I saw from far, with the dividing one, thus beyond the lower; the heroes cooked a spotted ox (''ukṣán''); those were the first ordinances.
9.10.26 Three hairy ones look out seasonably; in the (a?) year one of them shears itself; another looks upon all with might (''çácībhis''); of one is seen the rush, not the form.
9.10.27 Speech [is] four measured out quarters (''padá''); those are known by Brahmans who are skilful; three, deposited in secret, they do not set in motion (''in̄gay-''); a fourth of speech human beings speak.
9.10.28 They call [him] Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni; likewise he [is] the heavenly winged eagle; what is one the sages (''vípra'') name (''vad'') variously; they call [him] Agni, Yāma, Mātariçvan.
;;; 1 Against witchcraft and its practisers.
10.1.1 She whom the adepts {''cikitsú'') prepare, all-formed, hand-made, like a bride at a wedding - let her go far off; we push her away.
10.1.2 Having a head, having a nose, having ears, put together, all-formed, by the witchcraft-maker - let her go far off; we push her away.
10.1.3 Çūdra-made, king-made, woman-made, made by Brahmans (''brahmán''), like a wife expelled (''nuttá'') by her husband, let her go to her maker, as connection.
10.1.4 With this herb have I spoiled all witchcrafts - what one they have made in the field, what in the kine, or what in thy men.
10.1.5 Let evil be to the evil-doer, a curse to the curser; backward we send [her] forth back, that she may slay the witchcraft-maker.
10.1.6 Opposed [is] the Ān̄girasa, our appointed (''puróhita'') overseer; do thou, having turned the witchcrafts in the opposite direction, slay yonder witchcraft-makers.
10.1.7 He who said to thee "go forth," against the current, up-stream, him, O witchcraft, do thou return against; seek not us who are innocent.
10.1.8 He who put together thy joints, as an ''ṛbhú'' [those] of a chariot with skill (''dhī́''), unto him go thou; there is thy going; this person is unknown to thee.
10.1.9 They who, having made, took hold of thee, cunning sorcerers - this is a healthful (''çambhú'') spoiler of witchcraft, counteracting, reverting; therewith do we bathe thee.
10.1.10 In that we have come upon the ill-portioned one (fem.), bathed forth, whose young (''-vatsá'') is dead - let all ill (''pāpá'') go away from me; let property come unto (''upa-sthā'') me.
10.1.11 In that they have taken (''grah'') the name of thee giving to the Fathers, or at the sacrifice - let these plants free thee from all ill that is designed (? ''saṁdeçyà'').
10.1.12 From sin against the gods, against the Fathers, from name-taking, that is designed, that is devised against [any one], let the plants free thee by their energy (''vīryà''), with spell (''bráhman''), with verses, with milk of the seers.
10.1.13 As the wind sets in motion the dust from the earth and the cloud (''abhrá'') from the atmosphere, so from me may everything of evil nature go away, pushed by the spell (''bráhman'').
10.1.14 Step away, making much noise, like an unfastened she-ass; attain thy makers, pushed hence by an energetic spell.
10.1.15 Saying "this is the road, O witchcraft," we conduct thee; thee that wast sent forth against [us] we send forth back again; by that [road] go against [them], breaking, like a draft-cow with a cart, all-formed, wearing a wreath (? ''kurūṭín'').
10.1.16 Offward is light for thee, hitherward is no road for thee; make thy goings elsewhere than [toward] us; go thou by a distant [road] beyond ninety difficult navigable streams; do not wound thyself; go away.
10.1.17 As the wind the trees, do thou crush (''mṛ'') down, cause to fall; do not leave of them cow, horse, man; turning back, O witchcraft, from here to thy makers, awaken them unto childlessness.
10.1.18 What [witchcraft] they buried for thee in the ''barhís'', what in the cemetery, [what] witchcraft or secret spell (''valagá'') in the field, or practised against thee in the householders' fire - they, being wiser, [against thee] who art simple, innocent.
10.1.19 We have found out (''anu-vid'') the hostile sneaking magic (? ''kártra'') that was applied, perceived (? ''anu-budh''), buried: let that go whence it was brought; there let it roll about like a horse; let it slay the progeny of the witchcraft -maker.
10.1.20 There are knives of good metal in our house; we know thy joints, O witchcraft, how many they are; just stand up; go away from here; unknown one, what seekest thou here?
10.1.21 Thy neck-bones (''grīvā́''), O witchcraft, and thy (two) feet I will cut up; run thou out; let Indra-and-Agni defend us, they who are of progeny rich in progeny.
10.1.22 King Soma [is] our over-ruler and favorer (''mṛḍitṛ́''); let the lords of being favor us.
10.1.23 Let Bhava-and-Çarva hurl (''as'') at the evil-doer, the witchcraft-maker, the ill-doer, the missile of the gods, the lightning.
10.1.24 If thou camest [as] biped, as quadruped, put together by the witchcraft-maker, all-formed, do thou, becoming octoped, go away again from here, O misfortune!
10.1.25 Anointed, smeared, well-adorned, bearing all difficulty, go thou away; recognize (''jñā''), O witchcraft, thy maker, as a daughter her own father.
10.1.26 Go away, O witchcraft; stand not; lead, as it were, the track of one pierced; it is a deer, thou a deer-hunter; it is unable to put thee down.
10.1.27 Also the after one (''ápara'') slays with an arrow, fitting it (?), the one shooting (''-āsin'') in front; also of the front one, smiting down, the after one smites down in return.
10.1.28 Hear thou, verily, these words of mine; then go whence thou camest, to meet him who made thee.
10.1.29 The slaying of an innocent person is indeed fearful, O witchcraft; slay thou not our cow, horse, man; wheresoever thou art set down, from there we make thee stand up; become thou lighter than a leaf.
10.1.30 If ye are covered (''ā-vṛ'') with darkness, like those who are girt (''abhi-dhā'') with a net - having torn up (''sam-lup'') all witchcrafts from here, we send them forth again to the maker.
10.1.31 The progeny of the witchcraft-maker, of him of secret spells, of him that devises against [others], O witchcraft, do thou kill; do not leave [them alive]; slay yonder witchcraft-makers.
10.1.32 As the sun is freed out of darkness, [and] quits the night and the ensigns of the dawn, so do I quit all evil-natured magic made by the witchcraft-maker, as an elephant the difficult haze (? ''rájas'').
;;; 2 The wonderful structure of man.
10.2.1 By whom were brought the two heels of a man (''púruṣa'')? by whom was his flesh put together? by whom his two ankle-joints (''gulphá'')? by whom his cunning (''péçana'') fingers? by whom his apertures? by whom his (two) ''uchlakhás'' in the midst? who [put together] his footing (''pratiṣṭhā́'')?
10.2.2 From what, now, did they make a man's two ankle-joints below, his two knee-joints above? separating (? ''nir-ṛ'') his two back-thighs (''ján̄ghā''), where, forsooth, did they set them in? the two joints of his knees - who indeed understands (''cit'') that?
10.2.3 There is joined, fourfold (''cátuṣṭaya''), with closed (''sáṁhita-'') ends, above the two knees, the pliant (''çithirá'') trunk; what the hips are, the thighs - who indeed produced (''jan'') that, by which the body (''kúsindha'') became very firm?
10.2.4 How many gods [and] which were they, who gathered (''ci'') the breast, the neck-bones of man? how many disposed the two teats? who the two collar-bones (? ''kaphoḍá'')? how many gathered the shoulder-bones (pl.)? how many the ribs?
10.2.5 Who brought together his two arms, saying "he must perform heroism"? what god then set on his two shoulders upon the body (''kúsindha'')?
10.2.6 Who bored out the seven apertures in his head - these ears, the nostrils, the eyes, the mouth? in the might of whose conquest (''vijayá'') in many places quadrupeds [and] bipeds go their way.
10.2.7 Since in his jaws he put his ample (''purūcī́'') tongue, then attached (''adhi-çri'') [to it] great voice; he rolls greatly on among existences, clothing himself in the waters: who indeed understands that?
10.2.8 Which was that god who [produced] his brain, his forehead, his hindhead (? ''kakā́ṭikā''), who first his skull, who, having gathered a gathering in man's jaws, ascended to heaven?
10.2.9 Numerous things dear and not dear, sleep, oppressions and wearinesses, delights and pleasures - from where does formidable man bring (''vah'') them?
10.2.10 Whence now in man [come] mishap, ruin, perdition, misery, accomplishment, success, non-failure? whence thought (''matí''), uprisings (''úditi'')?
10.2.11 Who disposed in him waters, moving apart, much moving, produced for river-running, strong (''tīvrá''), ruddy, red, dark and turbid, upward, downward, crosswise in man?
10.2.12 Who set form in him? who both bulk (''mahmán'') and name? who [set] in him progress (''gātú'')? who display (''ketú'')? who [set] behaviors (''carítra'') in man?
10.2.13 Who wove in him breath? who expiration and respiration (''vyāná'')? what god attached (''adhi-çri'') conspiration (''samāná'') to man here?
10.2.14 What one god set sacrifice in man here? who [set] in him truth? who untruth? whence [comes] death? whence the immortal?
10.2.15 Who put about him clothing (''vā́sas'')? who prepared (''kalpay-'') his life-time? who extended to him strength? who prepared his swiftness?
10.2.16 With what did he stretch the waters along? with what did he make the day to shine? with what did he kindle (''anu-idh'') the dawn? with what did he give the coming-on of evening?
10.2.17 Who put in him seed, saying "let his line be extended"? who conveyed into him wisdom? who gave (''dhā'') [him] music? who dances?
10.2.18 With what did he cover this earth? with what did he surround the sky? by what is man a match for (''abhí'') mountains in greatness? by what, for deeds?
10.2.19 With what does he go after Parjanya? with what [after] the out-looking Soma? with what [after] both sacrifice and faith? by whom was mind put in him?
10.2.20 Wherewith does he obtain one learned in revelation (''çrótriya'')? wherewith this most exalted one? wherewith does man [obtain] this Agni? wherewith did he measure (make?) the year?
10.2.21 The ''bráhman'' obtains one learned in revelation, the ''bráhman'' this most exalted one; the ''bráhman'' [as] man this Agni; the ''bráhman'' measured the year.
10.2.22 Wherewith does he dwell upon (? ''anu-kṣi'') the gods? wherewith [upon] the people of the god-folk? wherewith this other asterism? whereby is authority (''kṣatrá'') called real (''sát'')?
10.2.23 The ''bráhman'' dwells upon the gods, the ''bráhman'' [upon] the people of the god-folk; the ''bráhman'' this other asterism; the ''bráhman'' is called real authority.
10.2.24 By whom is this earth disposed? by whom the sky set above? by whom this atmosphere, the expanse, set aloft and across?
10.2.25 By the ''bráhman'' is the earth disposed; the ''bráhman'' [is] the sky set above, the ''bráhman'' this atmosphere, the expanse, set aloft and across.
10.2.26 Atharvan, having sewed together his head, and also (''yát'') his heart - aloft from the brain the purifying one sent [them] forth, out of the head.
10.2.27 Verily that head of Atharvan [is] a god-vessel, pressed together; breath defends that, the head, food, also mind.
10.2.28 Was he now created upward (''ūrdhvá'')? [or] was he now created crosswise? did man grow unto (''ā-bhū'') all the quarters? - he who knoweth the ''bráhman's'' stronghold, from which man is [so] called.
10.2.29 Whoever indeed knoweth that ''bráhman's'' stronghold, covered with ''amṛ́ta'' - unto him both the ''bráhman'' and the Brahmans have given sight, breath, progeny.
10.2.30 Him verily sight doth not desert, nor breath, before old age, who knoweth the ''bráhman's'' stronghold (''púr''), from which man (''púruṣa'') is [so] called.
10.2.31 Eight-wheeled, nine-doored, is the impregnable stronghold of the gods; in that is a golden vessel, heaven-going (''svargá''), covered with light.
10.2.32 In that golden vessel, three-spoked, having three supports - what soul-possessing monster (''yakṣá'') there is in it, that verily the knowers of the ''bráhman'' know.
10.2.33 The ''bráhman'' entered into the resplendent, yellow, golden, unconquered stronghold, that was all surrounded with glory.
;;; 3 With an amulet of varaṇá.
10.3.1 This ''varaṇá'' [is] my rival-destroying, virile (''vṛ́ṣan'') amulet; with it do thou take hold of thy foes, slaughter thy injurers (''durasy-'').
10.3.2 Crush them, slaughter, take hold; be the amulet thy forerunner in front; the gods by the ''varaṇá'' warded off the hostile practice (''abhyācārá'') of the Asuras from one morrow to another.
10.3.3 This amulet, the ''varaṇá'', all-healing, thousand-eyed, yellow, golden - it shall make thy foes go downward; do thou, in front, damage them that hate thee.
10.3.4 This ''varaṇá'' [shall ward off] the witchcraft extended for thee; this shall shield thee against fear arising from men, this against all evil.
10.3.5 The ''varaṇá'', this divine forest-tree, shall ward off; the ''yákṣma'' that has entered into this man - that have the gods warded off.
10.3.6 If, having slept, thou shalt see an evil dream; if a wild beast (''mṛgá'') shall run a disagreeable course - from overmuch (? pari-) sneezing, from the evil utterance of a bird (''çakúni''), this amulet, the ''varaṇá'', shall shield thee.
10.3.7 From the niggard, from perdition, from sorcery, also from fear, from the more violent deadly weapon of death, the ''varaṇá'' shall shield thee.
10.3.8 What sin my mother, what my father, and what my own brothers, what we ourselves have done, from that shall this divine forest-tree shield us.
10.3.9 Driven (''vyath'') forth by the ''varaṇá'', my enemies (''bhrā́tṛvya'') [who are my] kinsmen have gone unto unlighted (? ''asū́rta'') space (''rájas''); let them go to lowest darkness.
10.3.10 Unharmed [am] I, with unharmed kine, long-lived, having all my men; let this amulet, the ''varaṇá'', protect me, being such, from every quarter.
10.3.11 This ''varaṇá'' on my breast, king, divine forest-tree - let it drive (''bādh'') away my foes, as Indra the barbarians, the Asuras.
10.3.12 I bear this ''varaṇá'' being long-lived, one of a hundred autumns; may it assign to me both kingdom and authority, to me cattle and force.
10.3.13 As the wind breaks with force the trees, the forest-trees, so do thou break my rivals, those born before and after; let the ''varaṇá'' defend thee.
10.3.14 As both wind and fire devour (''psā'') the trees, the forest-trees, so do thou devour my rivals, those born etc. etc.
10.3.15 As, destroyed by the wind, the trees lie prostrate (''nyàrpita''), so do thou destroy, prostrate my rivals, those born etc. etc.
10.3.16 Them, O ''varaṇá'', do thou cut off (''pra-chid''), before what is appointed (''diṣṭá''), before [the end of] their life-time - them who strive to damage him in respect to cattle, and who are intent to damage his kingdom.
10.3.17 As the sun shines exceedingly, as in it brilliancy is set, so let the ''varaṇá'' amulet fix (''ni-yam'') in me fame [and] growth; let it sprinkle me with brilliancy; let it anoint me with glory.
10.3.18 As glory [is] in the moon, and in the men-beholding Āditya, so let the ''varaṇá'' amulet etc. etc.
10.3.19 As glory [is] in the earth, as in this Jātavedas, so let the ''varaṇá'' amulet etc. etc.
10.3.20 As glory [is] in the maiden, as in this constructed (''sámbhṛta'') chariot, so let the ''varaṇá'' amulet etc. etc.
10.3.21 As glory [is] in Soma-drink, as in honey-mixture [is] glory, so let the ''varaṇá'' amulet etc. etc.
10.3.22 As glory [is] in the agnihotrá, as in the ''váṣaṭ''-utterance [is] glory, so let the ''varaṇá'' amulet etc. etc.
10.3.23 As glory [is] set in the sacrificer, as in this sacrifice, so let the ''varaṇá'' amulet etc. etc.
10.3.24 As glory [is] in Prajāpati, as in this most exalted one, so let the ''varaṇá'' amulet etc. etc.
10.3.25 As in the gods [is] immortality (''amṛ́ta''), as in them is set truth, so let the ''varaṇá'' amulet etc. etc.
;;; 4 Against snakes and their poison.
10.4.1 Indra's [was] the first chariot, the gods' the after chariot, Varuna's the third one; the snakes' chariot, the furthest one (?), hath run against the pillar: then may it come to harm (?).
10.4.2 ''Darbhá''-grass, brightness, young shoot (? ''tarū́ṇaka''); horse's tail-tuft, rough-one's tail-tuft; chariot's seat (? ''bándhura'').
10.4.3 Smite down, O white one, with the foot, both the fore and the hind; like water-floated wood, sapless [is] the snakes' poison, fierce water (''vā́r'').
10.4.4 The ''araṁghuṣá'', having immerged, having emerged, said again: like water-floated wood, sapless is the snake's poison, fierce water.
10.4.5 Pāidva slays the ''kasarṇī́la'' (snake), Pāidva the whitish and the black; Pāidva hath split altogether the head of the ''ratharvī́'', of the ''pṛdākū́''.
10.4.6 Go forth first, O Pāidva; we come after thee; cast thou out the snakes from the road by which we come.
10.4.7 Here was Pāidva born; this [is] his going-away; these [are] the tracks of the snake-slaying vigorous steed.
10.4.8 What is shut together may it not open; what is opened may it not shut together; in this field [are] two snakes, both a female and a male; those [are] both sapless.
10.4.9 Sapless here [are] the snakes, they that are near and they that are far; with a club (''ghaná'') I slay the stinger (''vṛ́çcika''), with a staff the snake that has come.
10.4.10 This is the remedy of both, of the ill-horse (''aghāçvá'') and of the constrictor; the mischievous (''aghāy-'') snake hath Indra, the snake hath Pāidva put in my power (''randhay-'').
10.4.11 We reverence Pāidva, the staunch one, of staunch abode (-''dhā́man''); here behind sit ''pṛ́dākus'', plotting forth.
10.4.12 Of lost lives, of lost poison [are they], slain by the thunderbolt-bearing Indra; Indra hath slain, we have slain.
10.4.13 Slain [are] the cross-lined ones, crushed down the ''pṛ́dākus;'' slay thou the whitish [snake] that makes a great hood, the black snake, in the ''darbhá''-grasses.
10.4.14 The little girl of the Kirātas, she the little one, digs a remedy, with golden shovels, upon the ridges (''sā́nu'') of the mountains.
10.4.15 Hither hath come the young physician, slayer of the spotted ones, unconquered; he verily is a grinder-up of both, the constrictor and the stinger.
10.4.16 Indra hath put the snake in my power, [also] both Mitra and Varuṇa, and Vāta ('wind') and Parjanya, both of them.
10.4.17 Indra hath put the snake in my power, the ''pṛ́dāku'' and the she-''pṛ́dāku'', the constrictor, the cross-lined one, the ''kasarṇī́la'', the ''dáçonasi''.
10.4.18 Indra hath slain first thy progenitor, O snake; of them, being shattered, what forsooth can be their sap?
10.4.19 Since I have grasped together their heads, as a fisherman the ''kárvara;'' having gone away to the middle of the river, I have washed out the snake's poison.
10.4.20 The poison of all snakes let the rivers carry away; slain [are] the cross-lined ones, crushed down the ''pṛ́dākus''.
10.4.21 I choose as it were the filaments of herbs successfully; I conduct as it were mares; O snake, let thy poison come out.
10.4.22 What poison is in fire, in the sun, what in the earth, in herbs, ''kāndā''-poison, ''kanáknaka'' - let thy poison come out; let it come.
10.4.23 Whichever of the snakes [are] fire-born, herb-born, whichever came hither (''ā-bhū'') [as] water-born lightnings; those of which the kinds are variously great - to those serpents would we pay worship with reverence.
10.4.24 Thou art a girl, ''tāúdī'' by name; verily thou art by name ghee-like (''ghṛtā́cī''); I take beneath thy poison-spoiling track.
10.4.25 Remove thou [it] from every limb; make [it] avoid the heart; then, what keenness (''téjas'') the poison has, let that go downward for thee.
10.4.26 He (it ?) hath come to be afar; he hath obstructed the poison; he hath mixed poison in poison; Agni hath put out the snake's poison; Soma hath conducted [it] out; the poison hath gone after the biter; the snake hath died.
;;; 5 Preparation and use of water-thunderbolts.
10.5.1 Indra's force are ye; Indra's power are ye; Indra's strength are ye; Indra's heroism are ye; Indra's manliness are ye; unto a conquering junction (''yóga'') with ''brahman''-junctions I join you.
10.5.2 Indra's force etc. etc.; unto a conquering junction, with ''kṣatrá-''junctions I join you.

10.5.6 Indra's force etc. etc.; unto a conquering junction; let all existences wait upon (''upa-sthā'') me; joined to me are ye, O waters.
10.5.7 Agni's portion are ye, sperm (? ''çukrám'') of the waters, O heavenly waters; put ye splendor in us; with the ordinance (''dhā́man'') of Prajāpati I set you for this world.

10.5.13 The Fathers' portion are ye, sperm of the etc. etc.
10.5.14 God Savitar's portion are ye, sperm of the etc. etc.
10.5.15 What of you, O waters, is the portion of waters within the waters, of the nature of sacrificial formula, sacrificing to the gods, that now I let go; that let me not wash down against myself; that do we let go against him who hates us, whom we hate; him may I slay (''vadh''), him may I lay low, with this spell (''bráhman''), with this act, with this weapon (''mení'').
10.5.16 What of you, O waters, is the wave of the waters within the waters, etc. etc.
10.5.17 What of you, O waters, is the young (''vatsá'') of the waters within the waters, etc. etc.
10.5.18 What of you, O waters, is the bull of the waters within the waters etc. etc.
10.5.19 What of you, O waters, is the golden embryo of the waters within the waters, etc. etc.
10.5.20 What of you, O waters, is the heavenly spotted stone of the waters within the waters, etc. etc.
10.5.21 What of you, O waters, are the fires of the waters within the waters, of the nature of sacrificial formula, sacrificing to the gods, them now I let go; them let me not wash down against myself; them we let go against him who hates us, etc. etc.
10.5.22 What untruth soever we have spoken since a three years' period, - let the waters protect me from all that difficulty, from distress.
10.5.23 I send you forth to the ocean; go ye unto your own lair; uninjured, of completed years (?); and let nothing whatever ail (''am'') us.
10.5.24 Free from defilement (''-riprá'') [are] the waters; [let them carry] away from us defilement, forth from us sin, mishap (''duritá''), they of good aspect; let them carry forth evil dreaming, forth filth.
10.5.25 Vishṇu's stride art thou, rival-slaying, earth-sharpened (''-sáṁçita''), Agni-brightened; after earth I stride out; from earth we disportion him who hates us, whom we hate; let him not live; him let breath quit.
10.5.26 Vishṇu's stride art thou, rival-slaying, atmosphere-sharpened, Vayu-brightened; after atmosphere I stride out; from atmosphere we disportion him who etc. etc.

10.8.3 Three offspring (''prajā́'') went an over-going; others settled (''ni-viç'') about the sun (? ''arká''); great stood the traverser (''vimā́na'') of space (''rájas''); the yellow one (m.) entered into the yellow ones (f.).

10.8.8 One carrying five carries the summit (''ágra'') of them; side-horses, harnessed, carry also along; what is not gone of it was seen, not what is gone; the higher thing [is] closer, the lower more distant.

10.8.23 Everlasting they call him, also may he be at present ever-renewed; day and night are generated (''pra-jā'') in each other's forms.
10.8.24 A hundred, a thousand, a myriad, a hundred million, an innumerable [number], is his own entered into him; that of him they slay, even as he looks on; therefore this god shines (''ruc'') thus.
10.8.25 One thing is more minute (''áṇu'') than a child (''bā́la''), also one is hardly (''né ’va'') seen; than that a more embracing deity, is she dear to me.
10.8.26 This beautiful one (f.) [is] unaging, an immortal in the house of a mortal; for whom she [was] made, he lies; he who made [her] grew old.

10.8.29 The full from the full he bends up (''ud-ac''); the full is poured with the full; also that may we know today, whence that is poured out.
10.8.30 She, everlasting, born indeed of old, she, ancient, encompassed (''pari-bhū'') all; the great goddess of the dawn, shining forth, she looks forth by every one who winks.
10.8.31 The deity, Avi by name, sits enveloped with right; by her form these trees [are] green, green-garlanded.
10.8.32 Him that is near by he (?) deserts not; him that is near by he (?) sees not; see the wisdom (''kā́vya'') of the god: he died not, he grows not old.

10.8.36 One of them clothes himself in this earth; one encompassed the atmosphere; he of them who is disposer (''vidhartṛ́'') gives the sky; some defend respectively all regions (''ā́çā'').
10.8.37 Whoso may know the stretched-out string in which these offspring (''prajā́'') are woven in, whoso may know the string of the string, he may know the great ''brā́hmaṇa''.
10.8.38 I know the stretched-out string in which these offspring are woven in; the string of the string I know, likewise the great ''brā́hmaṇa''.
10.8.39 As between heaven-and-earth Agni went, burning on, all-consuming, where stood beyond they (f.) of one husband - where perchance was Mātariçvan then?
10.8.40 Mātariçvan was entered into the waters; the gods were entered into the seas; great stood the traverser of space; the purifying one entered into the green ones.
10.8.41 Higher, as it were, than the ''gāyatrī́'', upon the immortal (''amṛ́ta'') he strode out; they who know completely chant with chant - where then was seen the goat?
10.8.42 The reposer, the assembler of good things, like god Savitar, of true ordinances (''-dhárman''), he stood like Indra in the conflict for riches.
10.8.43 The lotus-flower of nine doors, covered with three strands (''guṇá'')  -  what soulful prodigy (''yakṣá'') is within it, that the ''bráhman''-knowers know.
10.8.44 Free from desire, wise (''dhī́ra''), immortal, self-existent, satisfied with sap, not deficient in any respect - knowing that wise, unaging, young soul, one is not afraid of death.

10.9.10 He obtains the atmosphere, the sky, the earth, the Ādityas, the Maruts, the quarters, all worlds, who gives her of the hundred rice-dishes.
10.9.11 Sprinkling forth ghee, well-portioned, the divine one will go to the gods; hurt not him who cooks thee, O inviolable one; go on to heaven, O thou of the hundred rice-dishes.
10.9.12 The gods that are stationed (''-sad'') in the sky, and that are stationed in the atmosphere, and these that are upon the earth - to them do thou always yield (''duh'') milk, butter, also honey.
10.9.13 What head is thine, what mouth is thine, what ears and what jaws are thine - let them yield to thy giver curd, milk, butter, also honey.
10.9.14 What lips are thine, what nostrils, what horns, and what thine eyes - let them yield etc. etc.
10.9.15 What lungs are thine, what heart, the ''purītát'' with the throat - let them yield etc. etc.

10.9.18 What marrow is thine, what bone, what flesh, and what blood - let them yield etc. etc.

10.9.25 Let thy two breasts (''kroḍá'') be sacrificial cakes, smeared over with sacrificial butter; having made them wings, O divine one, do thou carry him who cooks thee to heaven (''dív'').
10.9.26 What in the mortar, on the pestle, and on the hide, or what rice-grain, [what] kernel in the winnowing-basket, or what the wind, Mātariçvan, blowing (''pū''), shook (''math'') - let Agni as ''hótar'' make that well-offered.
10.9.27 The heavenly waters, rich in honey, dripping with ghee, I seat in separate succession in the hands of the priests (''brahmán''); with what desire I now pour you on, let all that fall to my lot; may we be lords of wealth.
;;; 10 Extolling the cow (vaçā́).
10.10.1 Homage to thee while being born, homage also to thee when born; to thy tail-tuft, hoofs, form, O inviolable one, be homage.
10.10.2 Whoso may know the seven advances (? ''pravát''), [and] may know the seven distances, whoso may know the head of the sacrifice - he may accept the cow (''vaçā́'').
10.10.3 I know the seven advances, I know the seven distances; I know the head of the sacrifice, and the outlooking soma in her.
10.10.4 By whom the sky, by whom the earth, by whom these waters are guarded - the cow, of a thousand streams (''-dhā́rā''), we address with worship (''bráhman'').
10.10.5 A hundred metal dishes (''kaṅsá''), a hundred milkers, a hundred guardians, upon the back of her; the gods that breathe in her, they know the cow singly.
10.10.6 Having the sacrifice for feet, cheer (''írā-'') for milk, ''svadhā́'' for breath, being ''mahī́lukā'', the cow, having Parjanya for spouse, goes unto the gods with worship (''bráhman'').
10.10.7 After thee entered Agni, after thee Soma, O cow; thine udder, O excellent one, is Parjanya; the lightnings are thy teats, O cow.
10.10.8 The waters thou yieldest (''duh'') first, the cultivated fields after, O cow; thou yieldest kingdom third, food, milk, O cow.
10.10.9 When, called by the Ādityas, thou didst approach, O righteous one, Indra made thee drink a thousand vessels (''pā́tra'') of soma, O cow.
10.10.10 When thou didst go following (''anváñc'') Indra, then the bull called thee; therefore the Vṛitra-slayer, angry, took thy milk (''páyas''), milk (''kṣīrá''), O cow.
10.10.11 When the lord of riches, angry, took thy milk, O cow, then this the firmament (''nā́ka'') now keeps (''rakṣ'') in three vessels.
10.10.12 In three vessels the heavenly cow took that soma, where Atharvan, consecrated, sat on a golden ''barhís''.
10.10.13 Since she has united (''sam-gam'') with soma, and with all that has feet, the cow has stood upon the ocean, together with the Gandharvas, the ''kalís''.
10.10.14 Since she has united with the wind, and with all winged ones, the cow danced forth in the ocean, bearing the verses, the chants.
10.10.15 Since she has united with the sun, and with all sight, the cow has overlooked the ocean, bearing excellent lights.
10.10.16 As, O righteous one, thou didst stand decked (''abhi-vṛ'') with gold, the ocean, having become a horse, mounted (''adhi-skand'') thee, O cow.
10.10.17 There the excellent ones united, the cow, the directress, also the ''svadhā́'', where Atharvan, consecrated, sat on a golden ''barhís''.
10.10.18 The cow is mother of the noble (''rājanyà''), the cow thy mother, O ''svadhā́;'' from the cow was born the weapon; from it was born intent (''cittá'').
10.10.19 The globule (''bindú'') went (''car'') up aloft, out of the summit (''kákuda'') of the ''bráhman;'' thence wast thou born, O cow; thence was the invoker born.
10.10.20 From thy mouth came (''bhū'') the songs (''gā́thā''), from thy nape-bones, O cow, [came] force; from thy belly (? ''pājasyà'') was born the sacrifice, from thy teats the rays.
10.10.21 From thy (two) fore-legs (''īrmá'') motion (''áyana'') was born, and from thy thighs (''sákthi''), O cow; from thine entrails were born eaters (''attrá''), out from thy belly (''udára'') the plants.
10.10.22 When (''yát''), O cow, thou didst enter along the belly of Varuṇa, thence the priest (''brahmán'') called thee up; for he knew thy guidance (''netrá'').
10.10.23 All trembled at the embryo, while being born, of her who gives not birth (? ''asūsū́''); for "the cow hath given birth," they say of her; shaped (m.) by charms (''bráhman''); for it is her connection.
10.10.24 One combines (''sam-sṛj'') the fighters who alone is in control (''vaçín'') of her; the sacrifices became energies (? ''táras''); the cow became the eye of energies.
10.10.25 The cow accepted the sacrifice; the cow sustained the sun; within the cow entered the rice-dish together with the priest (''brahmán'').
10.10.26 The cow they call immortality (''amṛ́ta''); the cow they worship (''upa-ās'') as death; the cow became this all - gods, men, Asuras, Fathers, seers.
10.10.27 Whoso knoweth thus, he may accept the cow; for so doth the all-footed sacrifice yield milk (''duh'') to the giver, unresisting.
10.10.28 Three tongues glisten (''dīdī'') within the mouth of Varuṇa; of these, the one that shines (''rāj'') in the middle is the cow, hard of acceptance.
10.10.29 The seed of the cow was quartered: the waters a quarter, the ''amṛ́ta'' a quarter, the sacrifice a quarter, the domestic animals a quarter.
10.10.30 The cow [is] the sky, the cow the earth, the cow Vishṇu, Prajāpati; the yield (''dugdhá'') of the cow did the Perfectibles (''sādhyá'') and they who are Vasus drink.
10.10.31 Having drunk the yield of the cow, the Perfectibles and they who are Vasus - they verily worship the milk (''páyas'') of her at the summit of the ruddy one.
10.10.32 Some milk her for soma; some worship ghee; they who gave the cow to the one knowing thus are gone to the triple heaven of the heaven.
10.10.33 Having given the cow to the Brahmans, one attains all worlds; for righteousness is set in her, also ''bráhman'', likewise penance.
10.10.34 On the cow the gods subsist; on the cow, men also; the cow became this all, so far as the sun looks abroad.
;;; 1 Accompanying a rice-dish offering.
11.1.1 O Agni, be thou born; Aditi here, suppliant, cooks a ''brahmán''-rice-dish, desiring sons; the seven seers, being-makers - let them churn thee here together with progeny.
11.1.2 Make ye smoke, O ye bulls, companions, ye that are aided by the unhateful (?), unto speech; this Agni [is] fight-overpowering, having good heroes, by whom the gods overpowered the barbarians.
11.1.3 O Agni, thou hast been born unto great heroism, unto the cooking of the ''brahmán''-rice-dish, O Jātavedas; the seven seers, being-makers - they have given thee birth; do thou confirm to this woman wealth with all heroes.
11.1.4 Kindled, O Agni, be thou kindled with kindling (''samídh''); mayest thou bring hither, knowing, the worshipful gods; for them cooking (''çrā'') the oblation, O Jātavedas, make thou this man to ascend to the highest firmament (''nā́ka'').
11.1.5 Threefold is set down the share that is yours of old - of gods, of Fathers, of mortals; know ye the portions (''áṅça''); I share them out to you; that one that is the gods' shall set this woman across.
11.1.6 O Agni, powerful, overcoming, thou overcomest; put down (''ni-ubj'') [our] hating rivals; let this measure (''mā́trā''), being measured, and measured, make [thy] fellows tribute-bringers to thee.
11.1.7 In company with thy fellows, be thou united with milk; urge her up unto great heroism; ascend aloft to the summit (''viṣṭáp'') of the firmament (''nā́ka''), which they call by the name heavenly world.
11.1.8 Let this great one (''mahī́'') accept the hide, the divine earth, with favoring mind; then may we go to the world of the well-done.
11.1.9 Join thou on the hide these two allied stones; split apart the shoots (''aṅçú'') successfully for the sacrificer; smiting down, smite them that would fight her; bearing up thy progeny aloft, lift up.
11.1.10 Seize in thy hand, O hero, the two joint-acting (''sakṛ́t'') stones; the worshipful gods have come to thy sacrifice; three boons, whichsoever thou choosest - those successes do I here make successful for thee.
11.1.11 This [is] thy thought (? ''dhītí'') and this thy place of birth; let Aditi, of hero-sons, seize thee; cleanse away them that would fight her; confirm to her wealth with all heroes.
11.1.12 Sit ye in the wooden blower (? ''upaçvasá''); be ye winnowed, worshipful ones, from the husks. By fortune (''çrī́'') may we surpass all [our] equals; I make [our] haters to fall under foot.
11.1.13 Go away, woman; come back quickly; the stall (goṣṭhá) of the waters hath ascended thee for bearing; seize then of them f. whichever shall be worshipful; having shared [them] out wisely, then leave the others.
11.1.14 These maidens (''yoṣít'') have come, adorning themselves; stand up, woman, take hold of the mighty one; well-spoused with husband, progeny-possessing with progeny; to thee hath come the sacrifice; receive thou the vessel (''kumbhá'').
11.1.15 The portion of refreshment (''ū́rj'') [is] set down which [is] yours of old; do thou, instructed by the seer, bring these waters; let this sacrifice be for you progress-gaining (''gātu-víd''), refuge-gaining, progeny-gaining, formidable, cattle-gaining, hero-gaining.
11.1.16 O Agni, the worshipful pot hath ascended thee; bright (''çúci''), very hot, do thou heat it with heat; let those of the seers, those of the gods, gathering unto their share, very hot, heat this with the seasons.
11.1.17 Let these cleansed, purified, worshipful maidens, the waters, beauteous ones, creep down to the pot; they have given us abundant progeny, cattle; let the cooker of the rice-dish go to the world of the well-doers.
11.1.18 Cleansed with prayer (''bráhman'') and purified with ghee, shoots of Soma [are] these worshipful rice-grains; enter ye the waters; let the pot receive you; having cooked this, go ye to the world of the well-doers.
11.1.19 Spread thyself broad, with great greatness, thousand-backed, in the world of the well-done: grandfathers, fathers, progeny, descendants (''upajā́''): I am thy fifteen-fold cooker.
11.1.20 Thousand-backed, hundred-streamed, unexhausted, [is] the ''brahmán''-rice-dish, god-traveled, heaven-going; them yonder I assign to thee; lessen (?) thou them with progeny; be gracious then to me [as] bringer of tribute.
11.1.21 Go thou up to the sacrificial hearth; increase her with progeny; push [away] the demon; set her further forward; by fortune may we surpass all [our] equals; I make [our] haters to fall under foot.
11.1.22 Turn thou toward her together with cattle; be opposite to her together with the divinities; let not curse attain thee, nor witchcraft (''abhicārá''); bear rule (''vi-rāj'') in thine own field (''kṣétra''), free from disease.
11.1.23 Fashioned by righteousness (''ṛtá''), set by mind, this was ordained in the beginning the sacrificial hearth of the ''brahmán''-rice-dish; apply, O woman, the cleansed shoulder-bearer (?); on that set the rice-dish of them of the gods.
11.1.24 Aditi's hand, this second ladle (''srúc''), which the seven seers, being-makers, made - let that spoon, knowing the members of the rice-dish, collect it upon the sacrificial hearth.
11.1.25 Let them of the gods sit by thee, a cooked (''çṛtá'') oblation; having crept out of the fire, sit thou forward again to them; purified by soma, sit thou in the belly of the worshipers (''brahmán''); let not them of the seers, partakers (''prāçitṛ́'') of thee, suffer harm.
11.1.26 O king Soma, strew harmony for them, for whatsoever good Brahmans shall sit by thee; with good call, I call loudly to the ''brahmán''-rice-dish the seers, them of the seers, born from penance (''tápas'').
11.1.27 These cleansed purified worshipful maidens I seat in separate succession in the hands of the priests (''brahmán''); with what desire I now pour you on, may Indra here with the Maruts grant me that.
11.1.28 This my light (''jyótis''), immortal gold, cooked (''pakvá'') from the field, this my desire-milker; this riches I deposit in the Brahmans; I make a road to the Fathers that is heaven-going.
11.1.29 Strew thou the husks in the fire, in Jātavedas; wipe off far away the chaff (? ''kambū́kān''); this we have heard to be the share of the house-king; also we know the portion (''bhāgadhéya'') of Perdition (''nírṛti'').
11.1.30 Know thou the toiling, cooking, soma-pressing one; make him to ascend the heaven-going road, by which he may ascend, arriving at the vigor that is beyond, to the highest firmament, to the furthest vault (''vyòmati'').
11.1.31 Wipe off, O serving priest (''adhvaryú''), this face of the bearing one (? ''babhrí''); make thou, understanding it, room for the sacrificial butter; wipe off with ghee along all [its] members; I make a road to the Fathers that is heaven-going.
11.1.32 O bearing one, [as] a demon, strew discord for them, for whatsoever non-Brahmans shall sit by thee; rich in ground (? ''purīṣín''), spreading themselves forward, let not them of the seers, partakers of thee, suffer harm.
11.1.33 I set thee down, O rice-dish, among them of the seers; for them that are not of the seers there is no portion here; let Agni my guardian, and all the Maruts, let all the gods defend the cooked [offering].
11.1.34 The offering, yielding milk (''duh''), constantly full (''prápīna''), a male (''púmāṅs'') milch-cow, seat of wealth, immortality through offspring, and a long life-time - and may we sit by thee with abundance (pl.) of wealth.
11.1.35 Thou art a heaven-going bull; go to the seers, to them of the seers; sit in the world of the well-doing; there is there preparation (''saṁskṛtá'') for us both.
11.1.36 Gather thou together unto, go thou together forth after; O Agni, make ready (''kalpay-'') the roads traveled by the gods; by them, well-made, may we go after the offering, that stands upon the seven-rayed firmament.
11.1.37 With what light the gods went up to the sky, having cooked the ''brahmán''-rice-dish, to the world of the well-done, with that may we go to the world of the well-done, ascending the heaven, unto the highest firmament.

11.2.1 O Bhava-and-Çarva, be gracious; do not go against [us]; ye lords of beings, lords of cattle, homage to you! [the arrow] that is fitted, that is drawn, do not let fly; do not harm our bipeds nor quadrupeds.
11.2.2 Make ye not bodies for the dog, the jackal, for the buzzards (? ''alíklava''), the vultures, and them that are black [and] greedy (''aviṣyú''); let thy flies, lord of cattle, let thy birds not find themselves at food.
11.2.3 Unto thy noise (? ''kránda''), [thy] breath, and what pangs (? ''rópi'') are thine, O Bhava - homage we pay to thee that art thousand-eyed, O Rudra, immortal one.
11.2.4 We pay thee homage in front, above, also below; forth from the sphere of the sky, homage [be] to thine atmosphere.
11.2.5 To thy face, O lord of cattle; the eyes that thou hast, O Bhava; to [thy] skin, form, aspect, to thee standing opposite [be] homage.

11.2.9 Four times ''catús'' homage, eight times, to Bhava; ten times, O lord of cattle, be homage to thee; thine are shared out these five creatures (''paçú'') - cows, horses, men, sheep and goats.
11.2.10 Thine are the four directions, thine the heaven, thine the earth, thine, O formidable one, this wide atmosphere, thine is all this that has life (''ātmán''), that is breathing upon (''ánu'') the earth.
11.2.11 This wide vessel, holder of good things, is thine, within which are all these beings; do thou be gracious to us, O lord of cattle; homage to thee; away let the jackals, the portents (''abhibhā́''), the dogs go, away the weepers of evil with disheveled hair.
11.2.12 Thou bearest a yellow golden bow, a thousand-slaying, hundred-weaponed, O tufted one; Rudra's arrow goes, a god-missile; to that be homage, in whichever direction from here.
11.2.13 He who, attacked (''abhi-yā''), hides himself, [who] tries to put thee down, O Rudra, him from behind thou pursuest, like the tracker (? ''padanī́'') of one that is pierced.
11.2.14 Bhava-and-Rudra, allied, in concord, both go about, formidable, unto heroism; to them be homage, in whichever direction from here.
11.2.15 Homage be to thee coming, homage be [to thee] going away; homage to thee, O Rudra, standing; to thee sitting also [be] homage.
11.2.16 Homage in the evening, homage in the morning, homage by night, homage by day; to Bhava and to Çarva, to both have I paid homage.
11.2.17 With the thousand-eyed one, seeing across in front, with Rudra, hurling in many places, inspired one, may we not come in collision, as he goes about (''ī́ya-'') with the tongue.
11.2.18 We go forward (''pū́rva'') to meet him of dark horses, black, swarthy, killing, fearful, making to fall the chariot of the hairy one (''keçín''); homage be to him.
11.2.19 Do not let fly at us the club (? ''matyà''), the god-missile; be not angry at us, O lord of cattle; homage to thee; elsewhere than [over] us shake out the heavenly bough.
11.2.20 Do not harm us; bless us; avoid us; be not angry; let us not come into collision with thee.
11.2.21 [Be] not [greedy] for our kine, our men; be not greedy for our goats and sheep; elsewhere, O formidable one, roll forth [thy missile]; smite the progeny of the mockers (''píyāru'').
11.2.22 Of whom the ''takmán'', the ''kā́sikā'', goes as one weapon, like the noise of a stallion horse, to him, leading out in succession, be homage.
11.2.23 He who stands propped up in the atmosphere, killing the non-sacrificing, the god-mockers - to him be homage with the ten clever ones (''çákvarī'').
11.2.24 To thee are assigned the forest animals paçú, the wild beasts in the woods, the geese (''haṅsá''), eagles, hawks, birds; thine, O lord of cattle, is the monster (? ''yakṣá'') within the waters; for thine increase flow the waters of the heaven.
11.2.25 The dolphins (''çiṅçumā́ra''), boas (''ajagará''), ''purīkáyas'', ''jashás'', fishes, rajasás, at which thou hurlest: there is no distance for thee nor hindrance for thee, O Bhava; at once thou loolcest over the whole earth; from the eastern thou smitest in the northern ocean.
11.2.26 Do not, O Rudra, unite (''sam-sṛj'') us with the ''takmán'', not with poison, not with the fire of heaven; elsewhere than [on] us make that lightning fall.
11.2.27 Bhava is master (''īç'') of the heaven, Bhava of the earth; Bhava has filled the wide atmosphere; to him be homage, in whichever direction from here.
11.2.28 O king Bhava, be gracious to the sacrificer, for thou hast become cattle-lord of cattle; whoever has faith, saying "the gods are," be thou gracious to his bipeds [and] quadrupeds.
11.2.29 Not our great one, and not our small, not our carrying one, and not those that will carry, not our father and mother do thou harm; our own self (''tanū́''), O Rudra, do not injure.
11.2.30 To Rudra's howl-making, unhymned-swallowing (?), great-mouthed dogs I have paid this homage.
11.2.31 Homage to thy noisy ones, homage to thy hairy ones, homage to those to whom homage is paid, homage to the jointly-enjoying - homage, [namely], O god, to thine armies; welfare [be] to us, and fearlessness to us.

12.2.2 By evil-plotter and ill-plotter, by actor and helper, both all ''yákṣma'' and death do we thereby drive out from here.
12.2.3 Out from here do we drive death, perdition, out the niggard; whoso hates us, him, O non-flesh-eating Agni, do thou eat; whomso we hate, him do we impel to thee.
12.2.4 If the flesh-eating Agni, or if the tiger-like, hath entered this stall (''goṣṭhá''), being not at home (?), him, having made him to have beans for sacrificial butter, I send far forth; let him go unto the Agnis that have seat in the waters.
12.2.5 If angry men put thee forth (''pra-kṛ''), with fury, a man having died, that, O Agni, is easy to be arranged by thee; we make thee flame up again.
12.2.6 The Ādityas, the Rudras, the Vasus [have set] thee again; again, O Agni, the priest (''brahmán''), conductor of good; Brahmaṇaspati hath set thee again, in order to length of life-time to a hundred autumns.
12.2.7 If the flesh-eating Agni hath entered our house, seeing this other Jātavedas, him I take afar for the Fathers' sacrifice; let him kindle the hot drink (''gharmá'') in the highest station.
12.2.8 I send far forth the flesh-eating Agni; let him go, carrying evil (''riprá-''), to Yama's subjects; here let this other Jātavedas carry the oblation, a god to the gods, foreknowing.
12.2.9 I, being sent, take the flesh-eating Agni, a death, making people fixed with the thunderbolt; I, knowing, separate (? ''ni-çās'') him from the householder's fire; also in the world of the Fathers be he [their] portion.
12.2.10 The flesh-eating Agni, active, praiseworthy, I send forth by the roads that the Fathers go; come thou not back by those that the gods go; be thou just there (''átra''); watch thou over the Fathers.
12.2.11 They kindle the devouring one (''sáṁkasuka'') in order to well-being, becoming cleansed, bright, purifying; he abandons evil (''riprá''), passes over sin; Agni, kindled, purifies with a good purifier.
12.2.12 God Agni the devouring hath ascended the backs of the sky; being released out of sin, he hath released us from imprecation.
12.2.13 On this devouring Agni do we wipe off evils; we have become fit for sacrifice, cleansed; may he prolong our life-times.
12.2.14 The crushing ''sáṁkasuka'', the bursting (''víkasuka''), the destroying (''nirṛthá'') and the noiseless (? ''nisvará'') - they, of like possessions (? ''sávedas''), have made from far thy ''yákṣma'' to disappear afar.
12.2.15 The flesh-eating one that is in our horses, heroes, that is in our kine, goats-and-sheep, do we thrust out - the fire that obstructs the people.
12.2.16 Thee from inexhaustible (? ''ánya'') men, kine, horses, thee the flesh-eating one do we thrust out - the fire that obstructs life.
12.2.17 On what the gods wiped off, on what human beings (''manuṣyà'') also - on that having wiped off the drops of ghee (?), O Agni, do thou mount the sky.
12.2.18 Being kindled, O Agni, thou to whom oblations are made, go (''kram'') thou not away against us; shine just here by day, and that [we] long see the sun.
12.2.19 Wipe ye off on the lead; wipe ye off on the reeds; and what on the consuming fire; likewise on the dark (''rāmá'') ewe; headache on the pillow.
12.2.20 Having settled what is foul upon the lead [and] headache upon the pillow, having wiped off on the black ewe, be ye cleansed, fit for sacrifice.
12.2.21 Go away, O death, along a distant road which is thine here, other than that the gods go upon; I speak to thee having sight, hearing; let these many heroes be here.
12.2.22 These living ones have turned away from the dead; our invocation of the gods hath been auspicious (''bhadrá'') today; we have gone forward unto dancing, unto laughter; may we, rich in heroes, address counsel.
12.2.23 I set this enclosure for the living; let not another of them now go to that goal; living a hundred numerous autumns, let them set an obstacle to death with a mountain.
12.2.24 Mount, choosing old age for life-time, pressing on, one after another, as many as ye be; you here let Tvashṭar, him of good births, in accord [with you], lead on to living your whole life-time.
12.2.25 As days take place (''bhū'') one after another, as seasons go along with seasons, as an after one does not desert (''hā'') a preceding - so, O creator (''dhā́tṛ''), arrange their life-times.
12.2.26 The stony one flows (''rī''); take ye hold together; play the hero, pass over, O friends; quit here them that are of evil courses; may we pass up unto powers (? ''vā́ja'') that are free from disease.
12.2.27 Stand up, pass over, O friends; the stony river here runs (''syand''); quit ye here them that are unpropitious; may we pass up unto propitious pleasant powers.
12.2.28 Take ye hold on that of all the gods in order to splendor, becoming cleansed, clear, purifying; stepping over difficult tracks, may we revel a hundred winters with all our heroes.
12.2.29 By upward roads, full of wind, by distant (''pára'') ones, stepping over those that are lower (''ávara''), thrice seven times did the departed (''páreta'') seers bear back death with the track-obstructor.
12.2.30 Come ye, obstructing the track of death, assuming further on a longer life-time; sitting in your station, thrust ye [away] death; then may we, living, speak to the council.
12.2.31 Let these women, not widows, well-spoused, touch themselves with ointment, with butter; tearless, without disease, with good treasures (''-rátna''), let the wives ascend first to the place of union (''yóni'').
12.2.32 I separate (''vy-ā-kṛ'') these two by oblation; I shape them apart with a spell (''bráhman''); I make for the Fathers unwasting ''svadhā́;'' I unite these with a long life-time.
12.2.33 What Agni, O Fathers, hath entered into our hearts, an immortal into mortals, that god do I enclose in me; let him not hate us, nor let us [hate] him.
12.2.34 Having turned away from the householder's fire, go ye forth to the right with the flesh-eating one; do ye what is dear to the Fathers, to self, what is dear to the priests (''brahmán'').
12.2.35 The flesh-eating Agni that is unremoved (''á-nir-ā-hita''), taking to himself the double-portioned riches of the oldest son, destroys [him] with ruin.
12.2.36 What one plows, what one wins (''van''), and what one gains (''vid'') by pay (''vasná'') - all that is not a mortal's, if the flesh-eating one be unremoved.
12.2.37 He becomes unfit for sacrifice, of smitten splendor; not by him is the oblation to be eaten; [him] the flesh-eating one cuts off from plowing, kine, riches, whom it pursues.
12.2.38 A mortal, going down to mishap, speaks forth repeatedly with greedy ones (? ''gṛ́dhya''); whom (pl.) the flesh-eating Agni, from near by, after-knowing, follows (? ''vi-tāv'').
12.2.39 The houses are united with seizure (''grā́hi'') when a woman's husband dies; a knowing priest (''brahmán'') is to be sought, who shall remove the flesh-eating one.
12.2.40 What evil (''riprá''), pollution we have committed, and what ill-doing, from that let the waters cleanse me, and from the crushing Agni what.
12.2.41 These fore-knowing ones (f.) have turned hither upward from below by roads that the gods go upon; upon the back of the virile (''vṛṣabhá'') mountain the ancient streams (''sarít'') go about new.
12.2.42 O non-flesh-eating Agni, push out the flesh-eating one; bring the god-sacrificing one.
12.2.43 The flesh-eating one entered into this man; he has gone after the flesh-eating one; having made two tigers severally, I take him, who is other than propitious.
12.2.44 Concealment of the gods, defense (''paridhí'') of men (''manuṣyà''), the householder's fire is set (''çritá'') between both classes.
12.2.45 Lengthen thou out, O Agni, the life-time of the living; let them who are dead go unto the world of the Fathers; do thou, a good householder's fire, burning away the niggard, assign to this man an ever better dawn.
12.2.46 Overcoming, O Agni, all [our] rivals, do thou assign to us their refreshment [and] wealth.
12.2.47 Take ye hold after this saving (''pápri'') carrier (''váhni'') Indra; he shall carry you out of difficulty [and] reproach; by him smite away the on-flying shaft; by him ward off (''pari-pā'') Rudra's hurled [missile].
12.2.48 Lay ye hold after the draft-ox [as] float (''plavá''); he shall carry you out of difficulty [and] reproach; mount this boat of Savitar; may we cross over misery by the six wide [directions].
12.2.49 Day-and-night thou goest after, bearing, standing comfortable (''kṣemyá''), prolonging [life], having good heroes; bearing, O couch, healthful (''ánātura''), well-minded ones (m.), do thou long be for us smelling of men (''púrusagandhi'').
12.2.50 They fall under the wrath of the gods, they live always evilly, after whom the flesh-eating fire, from near by, like a horse, scatters reeds.
12.2.51 Whoever, without faith, from desire of riches then sit together with the flesh-eating one, they verily feed the fire (''ā-dhā'') about the pot (''kumbhī́'') of others always.
12.2.52 He desires, as it were, to fly forth with his mind; repeatedly he returns again - they whom the flesh-eating Agni, from near by, after-knowing follows.
12.2.53 A black ewe [is] of cattle [thy] portion; lead, too, they call thy gold (? ''candrá''), O flesh-eating one; ground beans are thy portion [as] oblation; seek (''sac'') thou the thicket of the forest-spirit (''araṇyānī́'').
12.2.54 Having made offering of withered (? ''járat'') cane (''iṣī́kā''), of ''tilpíñja'', of ''dáṇḍana'', of reeds; having made fuel of this, Indra removed Yama's fire.
12.2.55 Having sent in opposition an opposing (''pratyáñc'') song (''arká''), I, foreknowing, have entered abroad on the road; I have directed away the lifebreaths of them yonder; these here I unite with long life-time.
;;; 3 Cremation as a sacrifice.
12.3.1 Stand, a man (''púmāṅs''), upon men; go to the hide; call thither her who is dear to thee; of what age (? ''yā́vant'') ye two first came together in the beginning, let that be your same age in Yama's realm.
12.3.2 So much [be] your sight, so many your powers (''vīryà''), so great your brilliancy (''téjas''), so many-fold your energies (''vā́jina''); Agni fastens on (''sac'') the body when [it is his] fuel (?); then, O paired ones (''mithuná''), shall ye come into being from what is cooked (''pakvá'').
12.3.3 Together in this world, together on the [road] the gods travel, together also unite ye (du.) in the realms of Yama; purified by purifiers, call ye to yourselves whatever seed (''rétas'') came into being from you.
12.3.4 Enter together, ye sons, into the waters, coming together, ye rich in life, unto this living one (m.); of them (f.) share ye the one which (m.) they call immortal, the rice-dish which your (du.) generatrix cooks.
12.3.5 What one your (du.) father cooks, and what one [your] mother, in order to release from evil (''riprá'') and from pollution of speech - that hundred-streamed, heaven-going rice-dish hath permeated (''vi-āp'') with greatness both firmaments (''nábhas'').
12.3.6 Both firmaments, and worlds of both kinds, what heaven-going ones are conquered of the sacrificers - which one of them is chiefly (? ''ágre'') full of light, full of honey, in that combine ye (du.) with your sons in old age.
12.3.7 Take ye (du.) hold upon each forward direction; to this world they that have faith attach themselves (''sac''); what of you that is cooked is served up in the fire, combine ye, O husband-and-wife, in order to its guarding.
12.3.8 Attaining unto the southern quarter, turn ye (du.) about unto this vessel; in it shall Yama, in concord with the Fathers, assure abundant protection unto your cooked [offering].
12.3.9 This western of the quarters verily is a thing to be preferred, in which Soma is over-ruler and favorer; to it resort (''çri'') ye (du.); attach yourselves to the well-doers; then, O paired ones, shall ye come into being from what is cooked.
12.3.10 A superior realm, having superiority by progeny, may the northern of the quarters make our (pl.) apex (? ''ágra''); a five-fold (''pā́n̄ta'') meter hath the man become; may we come into being together with all, having all their limbs.
12.3.11 This fixed [quarter] is ''virā́j;'' homage be to it; let it be propitious to [my] sons and to me; do thou, O goddess Aditi, having all choice things, like an active herdsman defend our cooked [offering].
12.3.12 Do thou embrace us, as a father his sons; let propitious winds blow here for us on the earth; what rice-dish the two deities cook here, let that know our penance and also truth.
12.3.13 Whenever the black bird, coming hither, hath sat upon the orifice, surprising (''tsar'') what is resolved (''vi-sañj''), or when the barbarian woman (''dāsī́'') with wet hands smears over - cleanse, ye waters, the mortar [and] pestle.
12.3.14 Let this pressing-stone, broad-based, vigor-bestowing, purified by purifiers, smite away the demon; mount thou the hide; yield great protection; let not the husband-and-wife fall into evil proceeding from sons (''pāútra'').
12.3.15 The forest tree hath come to us together with the gods, forcing off the demon, the ''piçācás;'' he shall rise up (''ut-çri''), shall speak forth his voice; with him may we conquer all worlds.
12.3.16 Seven sacrifices (''médha'') the cattle enclosed - which ''the relative pronoun'' of them was full of light, and which was pining; to them thirty deities attach themselves; do thou (m.) conduct us (pl.) unto the heavenly (''svargá'') world.
12.3.17 Unto the heavenly world shalt thou conduct us (pl.); may we be united with wife, with sons; I grasp [her (?)] hand; let her (?) come here after me; let not destruction pass us, nor the niggard.
12.3.18 The seizure (''grā́hi''), evil (''pāpmán'') - may we go beyond them (pl.); dissipate thou the darkness; mayest thou speak forth what is agreeable; made of forest tree, uplifted, do not injure; do not crush to pieces ''vi-çṛ'' the god-loving rice-grain.
12.3.19 About to become all-expanded, ghee-backed, go thou, of like origin (''sáyoni''), unto that world; hand thou (''upa-yam'') the rain-increased sieve; let that winnow away the husk, the chaff.
12.3.20 The three worlds are commensurate with the ''brā́hmaṇa:'' yon heaven, namely, earth, atmosphere; having seized the [soma-] stalks, take ye (du.) hold after; let them swell up (''ā-pyā''); let them come again to the sieve.
12.3.21 Manifoldly separate [are] the forms of cattle; thou becomest one-formed together with success; that red skin - that thrust thou [away]; the pressing-stone shall cleanse like a fuller (? ''malagá'') the garments.
12.3.22 Thee that art earth I make enter into earth; this like body of thee [is] separated; whatever of thee is burnt (? ''dyuttá''), [or] scratched by driving (''árpaṇa''); with that do not leak; I cover that over by a spell (''bráhman'').
12.3.23 Mayest thou welcome as a mother a son; I unite (''sam-dhā'') thee that art earth with the earth; a kettle, a vessel, do not stagger upon the sacrificial hearth, overhung by the implements of offering [and] by sacrificial butter.
12.3.24 Let Agni, cooking, defend thee on the east; let Indra, with the Maruts, defend on the south; may Varuṇa fix thee in the maintenance (''dharúṇa'') of the western [quarter]; on the north may Soma give thee together.
12.3.25 Purified with purifiers, they purify themselves from the cloud; they go both to heaven and to earth [as their] worlds; them, lively, rich in life, firm-standing, poured into the vessel (''pā́tra''), let the fire kindle about.
12.3.26 They come from the sky, they fasten on (''sac'') the earth; from the earth they fasten upon the atmosphere; being cleansed, they just cleanse themselves; let them conduct us to the heavenly world.
12.3.27 Both as it were prevailing (''prabhú'') and also commensurate, also bright and clean, immortal - as such do ye, O waters, directed, helping, cook the rich-dish for the two spouses, ye of good refuge.
12.3.28 The numbered drops (''stoká'') fasten on the earth, being commensurate with breaths-and-expirations, with herbs; being scattered on, unnumbered, of good color, the clean ones have obtained all cleanness.
12.3.29 They struggle up (''ud-yudh''), they dance on, being heated; they hurl foam and abundant drops (''bindú''); like a woman that is in her season, seeing her husband, unite yourselves, O waters, with these rice-grains.
12.3.30 Make thou them stand up, as they sit on the bottom; let them touch themselves all over with the waters; I have measured with vessels (''pā́tra'') the water that is here; measured are the rice-grains that are these directions.
12.3.31 Reach thou forth the sickle (''párçu''), hasten, take [it] quickly; let them, not harming, cut (''dā'') the herbs at the joint; they of whom Soma compassed the kingship - let the plants be without wrath toward us.
12.3.32 Strew ye a new ''barhís'' for the rice-dish; be it dear to the heart, agreeable to the eye; on it let the gods [and] the divine ones (f.) settle (''viç'') together; sitting down (''ni-sad''), let them partake of this with the seasons.
12.3.33 O forest tree, sit on the strewn ''barhís'', being commensurate with the Agni-praises (''agniṣṭomá''), with the deities; like a form well made by an artisan (''tváṣṭṛ'') with a knife, so (''enā́'') let the eager ones be seen round about in the vessel (''pā́tra'').
12.3.34 In sixty autumns may he (?) seek unto the treasure-keepers; may he attain unto the sky with the cooked [offering]; may both fathers [and] sons live upon him; make thou this one to go unto the heaven-going end of the fire.
12.3.35 A maintainer, maintain thyself in the maintenance of the earth; thee that art unmoved let the deities make to move (''cyu''); thee shall the two spouses, living, having living sons, cause to remove (''ud-vas'') out of the fire-holder.
12.3.36 Thou hast come together unto all the worlds, having conquered; however many [be] the desires, thou hast made them wholly satisfied; plunge ye (du.) in - both the stirring-stick [and] the spoon; take thou him up upon one vessel.
12.3.37 Strew thou on, spread forward, smear over with ghee this vessel; as a lowing cow (''usrā́'') [toward] a young [calf] desiring the teat, do ye, O gods, utter the sound ''hing'' toward this one.
12.3.38 Thou hast strewn on, hast made that world; let the broad unequalled heavenly world (''svargá'') spread itself out; to it shall resort (''çri'') the mighty eagle; the gods shall reach him forth to the deities.
12.3.39 What in any case thy wife cooks beyond thee, or thy husband, O wife, in secret from thee, that do ye unite; that be yours together; agreeing (? ''sampāday-'') together upon one world.
12.3.40 How many of her fasten on (''sac'') the earth, what sons came forth into being from us (pl.) - all those do ye (du.) call to you in the vessel;. knowing the navel, the young ones (''çíçu'') shall come together.
12.3.41 What streams (''dhā́rā'') of good (''vásu'') [there are], fattened with honey, mixed with ghee, navels of immortality - all those doth the heaven-goer (? ''svargá'') take possession of; in sixty autumns may he seek unto the treasure-keepers.
12.3.42 He shall seek unto it, [as] treasure-keepers unto a treasure; let those who are others be not lords (''ánīçvara'') about; given by us, deposited, heaven-going, with three divisions it has ascended to three heavens (''svargá'').
12.3.43 Let Agni burn the demon that is godless; let the flesh-eating ''piçācá'' not have a draught here; we thrust him, we bar him away from us; let the Ādityas, the An̄girases, fasten on him.
12.3.44 To the Ādityas, the An̄girases, I announce this honey mingled with ghee; with cleansed hands, not smiting down [anything of] the Brahman's, go ye (du.), O well-doers, unto this heavenly world (''svargá'').
12.3.45 I have obtained this highest division of it, from which world the most exalted one obtained [it] completely; pour thou on the butter (''sarpís''); anoint with ghee; this is the portion of our An̄giras here.
12.3.46 Unto truth, unto penance, and unto the deities, we deliver this deposit (''nidhí''), [this] treasure (''çevadhí''); let it not be lost (''ava-gā'') in our play, nor in the meeting; do not ye release it to another in preference to (''purā́'') me.
12.3.47 I cook; I give; verily upon my action [and] deed (? ''karúṇa'') the wife; a virgin (? ''kāúmāra'') world hath been born, a son; take ye (du.) hold after vigor (''váyas'') that hath what is superior.
12.3.48 No offense is here, nor support (? ''ādhārá''), nor that one goes agreeing (''sam-am'') with friends; this vessel of ours is set down not empty; the cooked [dish] shall enter again him that cooked it.
12.3.49 May we do what is dear to them that are dear; whosoever hate [us], let them go to darkness; milch-cow, draft-ox, each coming vigor (''váyas'') - let them thrust away the death that comes from men.
12.3.50 The fires ire in concord, one with another - he that fastens on the herbs, and he that [fastens on] the rivers; as many gods as send heat (''ā-tap'') in the sky - gold hath become the light of him that cooks.
12.3.51 This one of skins (''tvác'') hath come into being on man; not naked are all the animals (''paçú'') that are other; ye (du.) cause to wrap (''paridhā'') yourselves (''ātmán'') with authority (''kṣatrá''), a home-woven garment, the mouth of the rice-dish.
12.3.52 What [untruth] thou shalt speak at the dice, what at the meeting, or what untruth thou shalt speak from desire of gain - clothing yourselves (du.) in the same web (''tántu''), ye shall settle in it all pollution.
12.3.53 Win thou rain; go unto the gods; thou shalt make smoke fly up out of the skin; about to become all-expanded, ghee-backed, go thou, of like origin, unto that world.
12.3.54 The heaven-goer hath variously changed his body, as he finds (? ''vidé'') in himself one of another color; he hath conquered off the black one, purifying a shining one (''rúçat''); the one that is red, that I offer (''hu'') to thee in the fire.
12.3.55 To the eastern quarter, to Agni as overlord, to the black [serpent] as defender, to Āditya having arrows, we commit thee here; guard ye him for us until our coming; may he lead on our appointed [life-time] here unto old age; let old age commit us unto death; then may we be united with the cooked [offering].
12.3.56 To the southern quarter, to Indra as overlord, to the cross-lined [serpent] as defender, to Yama having arrows, we commit thee here; guard ye etc. etc.
12.3.57 To the western quarter, to Varuṇa as overlord, to the ''pṛ́dāku'' as defender, to food having arrows, we commit thee here; guard ye etc. etc.
12.3.58 To the northern quarter, to Soma as overlord, to the constrictor as defender, to the thunderbolt having arrows, we commit thee here; guard ye etc. etc.
12.3.59 To the fixed quarter, to Vishṇu as overlord, to the spotted-necked [serpent] as defender, to the herbs having arrows, we commit thee here; guard ye etc. etc.
12.3.60 To the upward quarter, to Brihaspati as overlord, to the white [serpent] as defender, to rain having arrows, we commit thee here; guard ye etc. etc.
;;; 4 The cow (vaçā́) as belonging exclusively to the Brahmans.
12.4.1 I give [her] - thus should he say, if they have noticed (? ''anu-budh'') her - [I give] the cow (''vaçā́'') to the priests (''brahmán'') that ask for her; that brings progeny, descendants.
12.4.2 He bargains away his progeny and becomes exhausted of cattle who is not willing to give the cow (''gó'') of the gods to the sons of seers that ask for her.
12.4.3 By a hornless one they are crushed for him; by a lame one he falls (? ''ard'') into a pit; by a crippled one his houses are burned; by a one-eyed one his possessions are taken away (?).
12.4.4 Anæmia (''vilohitá'') from the station of the dung visits (''vid'') the master of kine; so is the agreement (?) of the cow; for door-damaging (?) art thou called.
12.4.5 From the station of the two feet of her, soaking (? ''viklíndu'') namely visits [him]; unexpectedly (?) are they crushed who snuff at her with the mouth.
12.4.6 Whoever punches (''ā-sku'') the two ears of her, he falls under the wrath of the gods; if he thinks "I am making a mark," he makes his possessions less.
12.4.7 If, for any one's advantage, any one cuts off the tail-tuft of her, then his colts die, and the wolf slays his calves.
12.4.8 If of her, while being with her master, a crow hath vexed (''hīḍ'') the hair, then his boys die, [and] the ''yákṣma'' visits him unexpectedly (?).
12.4.9 If the lye, the dung of her a barbarian woman flings together, then is born what is deformed, what will not escape from that sin.
12.4.10 When being born, the cow (''vaçā́'') is born for (''abhí'') the gods together with the Brahmans; therefore she is to be given to the priests (''brahmán''); that people call the guarding (''gópana'') of one's possessions.
12.4.11 They who come to the winning (''vaní'') of her, theirs is the god-made cow ''vaçā́''; they called it ''bráhman''-scathing, if anyone keeps her to himself.
12.4.12 Whoever is not willing to give the cow (''gó'') of the gods to the sons of seers that ask for her, he falls under the wrath of the gods and the fury of the Brahmans.
12.4.13 Whatever may be his use for the cow (''vaçā́-''), he should then seek another [cow]; she, ungiven, harms a man, if he is not willing to give her when asked for.
12.4.14 As a deposited treasure (''çevadhí''), so of the Brahmans is the cow (''vaçā́''); accordingly ''etát'' they come unto her, in whosesoever possession she is born.
12.4.15 They come thus unto their own property, namely the Brahmans unto the cow; as one might scathe them in any other respect (?), so is the keeping back of her.
12.4.16 She may go about until ''ā́'' the space of three years, being of unrecognized (''vi-jñā'') speech (''-gada''); should he know the cow, O Nārada, then the Brahmans are to be sought.
12.4.17 Whoever declares her to be not the cow, the deposited deposit of the gods, at him Bhava-and-Çarva, both, striding about, hurl the arrow.
12.4.18 Whoever knows not the udder of her, and likewise the teats of her, to him she yields milk with both, if he has been able to give the cow.
12.4.19 Door-damaging (?) lies she on him, if he is not willing to give her when asked for; he does not succeed in the desires which, without having given her, he would fain accomplish (''cikīrṣa-'').
12.4.20 The gods asked for the cow, having made the Brahman their mouth; the wrath (''héḍa'') of them all incurs (''ni-i'') the man (''mā́nuṣa'') who gives not.
12.4.21 He incurs the wrath of cattle (''paçú'') who gives not the cow to the Brahmans - if a mortal keeps to himself the deposited portion of the gods.
12.4.22 If a hundred other Brahmans should ask the cow of its master, yet (''átha'') the gods said of her: the cow is his who knoweth thus.
12.4.23 Whoever, not having given her to one who knoweth thus, then shall give the cow to others, hard to go upon for him in his station is the earth with its deity.
12.4.24 The gods asked the cow [of him] in whose possession she was first (''ágre'') born; that same one may Nārada know; together with the gods he drove her away.
12.4.25 The cow makes a man (''pū́ruṣa'') destitute of descendants, poor in cattle, if, when she is asked for by the Brahmans, then he keeps her to himself.
12.4.26 For Agni-and-Soma, for Love (''kā́ma''), for Mitra and for Varuṇa - for these the Brahmans ask her; under their wrath falls he who gives not.
12.4.27 So long as the master of her should not himself overhear the verses (''ṛ́ç''), so long may she go about among his kine (''gó''); she may not abide in his house after he has heard.
12.4.28 If any one, having overheard the verses of her, has then made her go about among his kine (''gó''), both the life-time and the growth of him do the gods, made wrathful, cut off (''vraçc'').
12.4.29 The cow, going about variously, the deposited deposit of the gods, manifests her forms, when she desires to go (?) to her station (''sthā́man'').
12.4.30 She manifests herself when she desires to go to her station; then the cow ''vaçā́'' makes up her mind for the asking of the priests (''brahmán'').
12.4.31 She plans (''sam-kḷp'') [it] with her mind; then she goes unto the gods; thence the priests (''brahmán'') go on to ask for the cow.
12.4.32 By offering of ''svadhā́'' to the Fathers, by sacrifice to the deities, by giving of the cow, the noble (''rājanyà'') does not incur (''gam'') the mother's wrath.
12.4.33 The cow is mother of the noble; so came it (n.) into being in the beginning; they call it a non-abandonment (? ''ánarpaṇa'') of her that she is presented to the priests (''brahmán'').
12.4.34 As one might snatch (? ''ā-lup'') from the spoon sacrificial butter held forth for the fire, so he who gives not the cow ''vaçā́'' to the priests falls under the wrath of Agni.
12.4.35 With the sacrificial cake as calf, milking well, she draws near to him in the world; she yields (''duh'') to him all his desires - [namely,] the cow ''vaçā́'' to him who has presented her.
12.4.36 All his desires, in Yama's realm, does the cow ''vaçā́'' yield to him who has presented her; likewise they call hell the world of him who keeps her back when asked for.
12.4.37 Being impregnated, the cow ''vaçā́'' goes about angry at her master: thinking me barren, let him be bound in the fetters of death.
12.4.38 And he who, thinking her barren, cooks the cow (''vaçā́'') at home (''amā́'') - his sons and sons' sons also does Brihaspati cause to be asked for.
12.4.39 She sends down great heat, going about a cow (''gó'') among kine; further, to the master who has not given her the cow (''vaçā́'') milks poison.
12.4.40 It is a thing dear to the cattle that she is presented to the priests (''brahmán''); further, that is a thing dear to the cow ''vaçā́'', that she be an oblation to the gods.
12.4.41 What cows the gods shaped out (''ut-kḷp''), rising up from the sacrifice, of them Nārada selected for himself the fearful ''viliptī́''.
12.4.42 The gods questioned (''mīmāṅs-'') about her: is this a cow ''vaçā́'', or not a cow.' Of her Nārada said: she is of cows the most truly cow (''vaçátama'').
12.4.43 How many, pray (''nú''), Nārada, are the cows which thou knowest, born among men (''manuṣyà-'')? those I ask of thee who knowest; of which may a non-Brahman not partake (''aç'')?
12.4.44 The ''viliptī́'', O Brihaspati, and the cow ''vaçā́'' that has given birth to [such] a cow - of that one a non-Brahman who should hope for prosperity (''bhū́ti'') may not partake.
12.4.45 Homage be to thee, O Nārada; [be] the cow to him who at once knows it. Which one of them is the most fearful, not having given which, one would perish?
12.4.46 She that is ''viliptī́'', O Brihaspati, further the cow that has given birth to [such] a cow - of that one a non-Brahman who should hope for prosperity may not partake.
12.4.47 Three verily are the kinds of cow: the vilipti, she that has given birth to [such] a cow, the [simple] cow yagd; these one should present to the priests (brahman), [then] he falls not under the wrath of Prajapati.
12.4.48 This, O Brahmans, is your oblation - so, when asked therefor, should he think, if they should ask of him the cow, which in the house of him who has not given her is fearful.
12.4.49 The gods talked about the cow in wrath, saying: he hath not given it to us; with these verses (''ṛ́c'') [they talked about] Bheda; therefore indeed he perished.
12.4.50 And Bheda gave her not, when asked by Indra for the cow ''vaçā́''; for that offense the gods cut him off in the contest for superiority.
12.4.51 They who, wheedling, advise (''vad'') to the non-giving of the cow ''vaçā́'', the villains fall under the fury of Indra through ignorance.
12.4.52 They who, leading away her master, then say: do not give - they, through ignorance, go to meet the hurled missile of Rudra.
12.4.53 If as offered (''hu'') and if as unoffered one cooks the cow ''vaçā́'' in private (''amā́''), coming into collision with the gods accompanied by the Brahmans, he goes supine (''jihmá'') out of the world.
;;; 5 The Brahman's cow.
12.5.1 By toil, by penance [is she] created, acquired by ''bráhman'', supported (''çritá'') on righteousness.
12.5.2 Covered with truth, enclosed with fortune, enveloped with glory.
12.5.3 Set about with ''svadhā́'', surrounded with faith, guarded by consecration, standing firm in the offering, the world her post (''nidhána'').
12.5.4 ''Bráhman'' her guide, the Brahman her over-lord.
12.5.5 Of the Kshatriya who takes to himself that Brahman-cow, who scathes the Brahman, -
12.5.6 There departs the happiness (''sunṛ́tā''), the heroism, the good luck.
12.5.7 Both force, and brilliancy, and power, and strength, and speech, and sense (''indriyá''), and fortune, and virtue (''dhárma''), -
12.5.8 And holiness (''bráhman''), and dominion ''kṣatrám'', and kingdom, and subjects (''víças''), and brightness (''tvíṣi''), and glory, and honor, and property, -
12.5.9 And life-time, and form, and name, and fame, and breath, and expiration, and sight, and hearing, -
12.5.10 And milk, and sap, and food, and food-eating, and righteousness, and truth, and sacrifice (''iṣṭá''), and bestowal (''pūrtá''), and progeny, and cattle: -
12.5.11 All these depart from the Kshatriya who takes to himself the Brahman-cow, who scathes the Brahman.
12.5.12 This same Brahman-cow [is] fearful, having deadly poison, witchcraft incarnate (''sākṣā́t''), ''kū́lbaja'' when covered.
12.5.13 In her are all terrible things and all deaths.
12.5.14 In her are all cruel things, all men-killers (''puruṣavadhá'').
12.5.15 This Brahman-cow, when taken to oneself, binds the Brahman-scather, the god-reviler, in the shackle of death.
12.5.16 Verily (''hí'') a hundred-killing weapon (''mení'') is she; verily the destruction of the Brahman-scather is she.
12.5.17 Therefore indeed is the cow of the Brahmans hard to be dared against by one who understands (''vi-jñā'').*
12.5.18 [She is] a thunderbolt when running, Vāiçvānara when driven up (''údvīta'').
12.5.19 A missile when extracting (''ut-khid'') her hoofs, the great god when looking away.
12.5.20 Keen-edged (''kṣurápavi'') when looking; when bellowing, she thunders at one.
12.5.21 Death when uttering ''hing;'' the formidable god when slinging about her tail.
12.5.22 Total scathing when twisting about her ears; king-''yákṣma'' when urinating.
12.5.23 A weapon (''mení'') when being milked; headache when milked.
12.5.24 Debility when approaching (''upa-sthā''); mutual strife when felt of.
12.5.25 A shaft when her mouth is being fastened up; mishap (''ṛ́ti'') when being slain.
12.5.26 Deadly poisonous when falling down; darkness when fallen down.
12.5.27 Going after him, the Brahman-cow exhausts the breaths of the Brahman-scather.
12.5.28 [She is] hostility when being cut up, the eating of one's children when being shared out.
12.5.29 A gods' missile when being taken, failure when taken.
12.5.30 Evil when being set on, harshness when being set down.
12.5.31 Poison when heating (? ''pra-yas''), ''takmán'' when heated.
12.5.32 Evil (''aghá'') when being cooked, bad dreaming when cooked.
12.5.33 Uprooting when being turned about (? ''pari-ā-kṛ''), destruction when turned about.
12.5.34 Discord by smell; pain (''çúc'') when being taken up, a poison-snake when taken up.
12.5.35 Non-prosperity when being served up, disaster when served up.
12.5.36 Çarva angered when being dressed (''piç''), Çimidā when dressed.
12.5.37 Ruin when being partaken of, perdition when partaken of.
12.5.38 When partaken of, the Brahman-cow cuts off the Brahman-scather from the world, from both this one and the one yonder.
12.5.39 The slaying of her is witchcraft, her cutting up (''āçásana'') is a weapon (''mení''), the contents of her bowels a secret charm.
12.5.40 [She is] homelessness when hidden (? ''pari-hnu'').
12.5.41 The Brahman-cow, having become the flesh-eating Agni, entering into the Brahman-scather, eats him.
12.5.42 All his limbs, joints, roots, she cuts off (''vraçc'').
12.5.43 She severs (''chid'') his paternal connection, makes perish his maternal connection.
12.5.44 All the marriages, acquaintances of the Brahman-scather does the Brahman-cow scorch (? ''api-kṣā''), when not given back by a Kshatriya.
12.5.45 Without abode, without home, without progeny, she makes him; he becomes without succession (?); he is destroyed: -
12.5.46 Whatever Kshatriya takes to himself the cow of a Brahman who knoweth thus.
12.5.47 Quickly, indeed, at his killing the vultures make a din (''āilabá'').
12.5.48 Quickly, indeed, about his place of burning dance the long-haired women, beating on the breast with the hand, making an evil din.
12.5.49 Quickly, indeed, in his abodes do the wolves make a din.
12.5.50 Quickly, indeed, they ask about him: what that was, is this now that?
12.5.51 Cut thou, cut on, cut forth, scorch, burn (''kṣā'').
12.5.52 O daughter of An̄giras, exhaust thou the Brahman-scather, that takes to himself [the cow].
12.5.53 For thou art called belonging to all the gods, witchcraft, ''kū́lbaja'' when covered.
12.5.54 Burning (''uṣ''), consuming, thunderbolt of the brahman.
12.5.55 Having become a keen-edged death, run thou out.
12.5.56 Thou takest to thyself the honor of the scathers, their sacrifice and bestowal, their expectations.
12.5.57 Taking to thyself what is scathed for him who is scathed, thou presentest [it to him] in yonder world.
12.5.58 O inviolable one, become thou the guide of the Brahman out of imprecation.
12.5.59 Become thou a weapon (''mení''), a shaft; become thou deadly poisonous from evil (''aghá'').
12.5.60 O inviolable one, smite forth the head of the Brahman-scather that has committed offense, of the god-reviler, the ungenerous.
12.5.61 Let Agni burn the malevolent one, slaughtered, crushed (''mṛd'') by thee.
12.5.62 Cut (''vraçc'') thou, cut off, cut up; burn thou, burn off, burn up.
12.5.63 The Brahman-scather, O divine inviolable one, do thou burn up all the way from the root.
12.5.64 That he may go from Yama's seat to evil worlds, to the distances.
12.5.65 So do thou, O divine inviolable one, of the Brahman-scather that has committed offense, of the god-reviler, the ungenerous, -
12.5.66 With a thunderbolt hundred-jointed, sharp, razor-pronged, -
12.5.67 Smite forth the shoulder-bones, forth the head.
12.5.68 His hairs (''lóman'') do thou cut up (''sam-chid''); his skin strip off; -
12.5.69 His flesh cut in pieces; his sinews wrench off; -
12.5.70 His bones distress (''pīḍ''); his marrow smite out; -
12.5.71 All his limbs, [his] joints unloosen.
12.5.72 Let the flesh-eating Agni thrust him from the earth, burn (''uṣ'') up; let Vāyu [do so] from the atmosphere, the great expanse (''varimán''); -
12.5.73 Let the sun thrust him forth from the sky, burn him down.
;;; 1 To Rohita (the sun, as ruddy one).
13.1.1 Rise up, O powerful one (? ''vājín'') that [art] within the waters, enter into this kingdom [that is] full of pleasantness; the ruddy one (''róhita'') that generated this all - let him bear thee, well-borne, unto kingdom.
13.1.2 Up hath arisen the power (? ''vā́ja'') that is within the waters; mount (''ā-ruh'') thou the clans (''víç'') that are sprung from thee (''tvádyoni''); assuming (''dhā'') the soma, the waters, the herbs, the kine, make thou the four-footed, the two-footed ones to enter here.
13.1.3 Do ye [who are] formidable, O Maruts, sons of the spotted mother, with Indra as ally, slaughter our foes; the ruddy one shall listen to you, ye liberal ones (''sudā́nu''), ye thrice seven Maruts that enjoy sweets together.
13.1.4 The ruddy one ascended (''ruh''), mounted the ascents (''rúh''); [he,] the embryo of the wives, [mounted] the lap of births; him, taken hold of by them (f.), the six wide [spaces] discovered; seeing in advance the track, he hath brought (''ā-hṛ'') hither the kingdom.
13.1.5 The ruddy one hath brought hither thy kingdom; the scorners have scattered; fearlessness hath become thine; unto thee, being such, let heaven-and-earth, by the ''revátīs'', yield (''duh'') here thy desire by the ''çákvarīs''.
13.1.6 The ruddy one generated heaven-and-earth; there the most exalted one stretched the line (''tántu''); there was supported (''çri'') the one-footed goat (? ''ajá''); by strength he made firm (''dṛh'') heaven-and-earth.
13.1.7 The ruddy one made firm heaven-and-earth; by him was established the sky (''svàr''), by him the firmament (''nā́ka''); by him the atmosphere, the spaces (''rájas'') were measured out; by him the gods discovered immortality (''amṛ́ta'').
13.1.8 The ruddy one examined (''vi-mṛç'') the all-formed, collecting to himself the fore-ascents and the ascents; having ascended the sky with great greatness, let him anoint (''sam-añj'') thy kingdom with milk, with ghee.
13.1.9 What ascents, fore-ascents thou hast, what on-ascents (''ārúh'') thou hast, with which thou fillest the sky, the atmosphere, with the ''bráhman'', with the milk of them increasing, do thou watch over the people (''víç'') in the kingdom of the ruddy one.
13.1.10 What clans (''víç'') of thine came into being out of ardor (''tápas''), those have come hither after the young (''vatsá''), the ''gāyatrī́;'' let them enter (''ā-viç'') into thee with propitious mind; let the ruddy young with its mother go against [them].
13.1.11 The ruddy one hath stood aloft upon the firmament (''nā́kā''), generating all forms, [he,] young, poet; Agni shineth forth with keen light; in the third space (''rájas'') he hath done dear things.
13.1.12 The thousand-horned bull Jātavedas, offered to with ghee, soma-backed, having good heroes - let him not abandon me; let me not, a suppliant, abandon thee*; assign thou to me both prosperity in kine and prosperity in heroes.
13.1.13 The ruddy one is generator and mouth of the sacrifice; to the ruddy one I make oblation with speech, with hearing, with mind; to the ruddy one go the gods with favoring mind; let him cause me to ascend with ascensions (''róha'') of meeting (''sāmityá'').
13.1.14 The ruddy one disposed the sacrifice for Viçvakarman; therefrom have these brilliancies come unto me; may I speak thy navel (''nā́bhi'') upon the range (''majmán'') of existence.
13.1.15 Unto thee ascended ''bṛhatī́'' and ''pan̄ktí'', unto [thee], O Jātavedas, ''kakúbh'' with honor; unto thee ascended the ''uṣṇíhā'' syllable, the ''váṣaṭ''-utterance; unto thee ascended the ruddy one along with seed.
13.1.16 This one clothes himself in the embryo (womb?) of the earth; this one clothes himself in the sky, the atmosphere; this one, on the summit of the reddish one, has penetrated the heaven (''svàr''), the worlds.
13.1.17 O lord of speech, [be] earth pleasant to us; [be] the lair (''yóni'') pleasant, [be] our couch very propitious; just here be breath in our companionship; thee here, O most exalted one, let Agni surround with life-time, with honor.
13.1.18 O lord of speech, the five seasons that are ours, that came forth into being as Viçvakarman's - just here be breath in our companionship; thee here, O most exalted one, let the ruddy one surround with life-time, with honor.
13.1.19 O lord of speech, [generate] well-willing and mind; generate kine in our stall (''goṣṭhá''), progeny in our wombs (''yóni''); just here be breath in our companionship; thee here, O most exalted one, I surround with life-time, with honor.
13.1.20 May Savitar, god Agni, surround thee [with honor]; with honor may Mitra-and-Varuṇa deck (''abhi''+''dhā'') thee; striding down all niggards come thou; thou hast made this kingdom full of pleasantness.
13.1.21 Thou whom the spotted one (f.), the side-horse, draws (''vah'') in the chariot, O ruddy one, thou goest with brightness (''çúbh''), making flow the waters.
13.1.22 She that is ruddy (''róhiṇī'') is submissive to the ruddy one, being liberal (''sūrí''), of beautiful color, vast (''bṛhatī́''), very splendid; by her may we conquer booty (? ''vā́jān'') of all forms; by her may we overcome all fighters.
13.1.23 Here the seat (''sádas''), she that is ruddy, of the ruddy one; yonder the road by which the spotted one (f.) goes; her the Gandharvas, the Kaçyapas, lead up; her the poets defend unremittingly.
13.1.24 The sun's yellow (''hári'') bright (''ketumánt'') horses, immortal, constantly draw the easy-running chariot; the ghee-drinking ruddy one, shining (''bhrāj''), the god, entered the spotted sky.
13.1.25 The ruddy one, the sharp-horned bull, who encompassed Agni, the sun, who props asunder (''vi-stabh'') the earth and the heaven - out of him do the gods create creations.
13.1.26 The ruddy one mounted the sky, out of the great sea (''arṇavá''); the ruddy one ascended all ascents.
13.1.27 Measure thou out (''vi-mā'') the milk-giving, ghee-dripping (''ghṛtā́ñc'') [cow]; this is the unresisting milch-cow of the gods. Let Indra drink the soma; let there be comfort (''kṣéma''); let Agni commence praising; do thou thrust away the scorners.
13.1.28 Agni, kindled, being kindled, increased with ghee, offered to with ghee - let the overpowering, all-overpowering Agni slay them who are my rivals.
13.1.29 Let him slay them, burn [them] away, - the enemy (''ári'') who fights us; by the flesh-eating fire do we burn away our rivals.
13.1.30 Do thou, O Indra, having arms, smite them down downward with the thunderbolt; then my rivals have I taken to myself with Agni's brightnesses (''téjas'').
13.1.31 O Agni, make our rivals fall below us; stagger the truculent (''utpípāna'') fellow, O Brihaspati; O Indra-and-Agni, O Mitra-and-Varuṇa, let them fall below [us], impotent in their fury.
13.1.32 Do thou, O heavenly sun, arising, smite down my rivals; smite them down with the stone; let them go to lowest darkness.
13.1.33 The young (''vatsá'') of the ''virā́j'', the bull of prayers (''matí''), mounted, bright-backed, the atmosphere; with ghee they sing (''arc'') the song (''arká'') unto the young; him, being ''bráhman'', they increase with ''bráhman''.
13.1.34 Both ascend thou to heaven and ascend to earth; both ascend to kingdom and ascend to property; both ascend to progeny and ascend to immortality; make thyself contiguous with the ruddy one.
13.1.35 The kingdom-bearing gods who go to surround (''abhítas'') the sun - in concord with them let the ruddy one, with favoring mind, assign kingdom to thee.
13.1.36 Sacrifices purified by ''bráhman'' carry thee up; yellow (''hári'') roadsters draw (''vah'') thee; thou shinest over (''ati-ruc'') across the ocean, the sea.
13.1.37 On the ruddy one are set (''çritá'') heaven-and-earth, on the goods-conquering, kine-conquering, booty-conquering one, of whom the births are a thousand and seven; may I speak thy navel on the range of existence.
13.1.38 Glorious thou goest to the directions and quarters, glorious of cattle and of people (''carṣaṇí''); glorious in the lap of earth, of Aditi, may I become pleasant (''cā́ru'') like Savitar.
13.1.39 Being yonder, thou knowest here; being on this side, thou seest those things; from this side they see the shining space (''rócana''), the inspired sun in the sky.
13.1.40 Thou, a god, molestest (''mṛc'') the gods; thou goest about within the sea (''arṇavá''); they kindle the same fire; it the high (''pára'') poets know.
13.1.41 Below the distant, thus beyond the lower, bearing her calf with her foot, the cow hath stood up; whitherwards, to what quarter, hath she forsooth gone away? where giveth she birth? for [it is] not in this herd.
13.1.42 One-footed, two-footed [is] she, four-footed; having become eight-footed, nine-footed, thousand-syllabled, a series of existence; out from her flow apart the oceans.
13.1.43 Mounting the sky, immortal, do thou favor my words; sacrifices purified by ''bráhman'' carry thee up; yellow roadsters draw thee.
13.1.44 I know that of thine, O immortal one, namely (''yát'') thy climb (''ākrámaṇa'') in the sky, thy station (''sadhástha'') in the highest firmament.
13.1.45 The sun overlooks (''ati-paç'') the sky, the sun the earth, the sun the waters; the sun, the one eye of what exists, hath mounted the great sky.
13.1.46 The wide ones (''urvī́'') were the enclosures; the earth took shape as sacrificial hearth; there the ruddy one set (''ā-dhā'') these two fires, cold and heat.
13.1.47 Having set cold and heat, having made the mountains sacrificial posts (''yū́pa''), having rain as sacrificial butter, the two fires of the sky-finding ruddy one performed sacrifice (''yaj'').
13.1.48 The fire of the sky-finding ruddy one is kindled with ''bráhman;'' therefrom heat, therefrom cold, therefrom the sacrifice was born.
13.1.49 The two fires [are] increasing by ''bráhman'', increased with ''bráhman'', offered to with ''bráhman:'' kindled with ''bráhman'', the two fires of the sky-finding ruddy one performed sacrifice.
13.1.50 The one is all set in truth, the other is kindled in the waters: kindled with etc. etc.
13.1.51 What one the wind adorns about, or what one Indra, Brahmaṇaspati: kindled with etc. etc.
13.1.52 Having shaped (''kḷp'') the earth as sacrificial hearth, having made the sky sacrificial fee, then having made heat his fire, the ruddy one made all that has soul, with rain as sacrificial butter.
13.1.53 Rain as sacrificial butter, heat as fire, earth as sacrificial hearth took shape; there, with songs (''gír''), the fire shaped these mountains aloft.
13.1.54 Having shaped [them] aloft by songs, the ruddy one said to the earth: in thee let this all be born, what is (''bhūtá'') or what is to be.
13.1.55 That first sacrifice was born [as] the one that is, that is to be; from that was born this all, whatsoever shines out (''vi-ruc'') here, brought (''ā-bhṛ'') by the ruddy one [as] seer.
13.1.56 Whoever both kicks a cow with the foot and urinates in face of the sun - of such a one I hew off (''vraçc'') thy root; thou shalt not further cast (''kṛ'') shadow.
13.1.57 Thou that goest past me shading me, and between me and the fire, I hew off thy root; thou shalt not further cast shadow.
13.1.58 Whoso this day, O heavenly sun, shall go between both thee and me - on him we wipe off evil-dreaming, pollution, and difficulties.
13.1.59 Let us not go forth from the road, nor, O Indra, from the sacrifice with soma; let not the niggards stand between us.
13.1.60 What line, accomplisher of the sacrifice, is stretched clear to the gods, that, sacrificed unto, may we attain.
;;; 2 To the sun.
13.2.1 The bright (''çukrá'') shining lights (''ketú'') of him go up in the sky - of the men-watching Aditya, him of great courses (''-vratá''), liberal (''mīḍhvā́ṅs'').
13.2.2 [Him,] shining (''svar'') with the brightness (''arcís'') of the foreknowing quarters, well-winged, flying swift in the ocean (''arṇavá'') - we would praise the sun, the shepherd of existence, who with his rays shines unto all the quarters.
13.2.3 In that thou goest swiftly eastward, westward, at will (''svadháyā''), makest by magic (''māyā́'') the two days of diverse form - that, O Āditya, [is] great, that thy great fame (''çrā́vas''), that thou alone art born about the whole world (''bhū́man'').
13.2.4 The inspired, hasting (''taráṇi''), shining one, whom seven numerous (''bahú'') yellow steeds (''harít'') draw, whom out of the liquid (? ''srutá'') Atri conducted up the sky - thee here they see going around upon thy race.
13.2.5 Let them not damage thee going around upon thy race; happily do thou cross the difficulties quickly; when, O sun, thou goest to both sky and divine earth, measuring out day-and-night.
13.2.6 Well-being, O sun, [be] to thy chariot for its moving, wherewith thou goest at once about both borders (''ánta'') - which thy yellow steeds, of excellent draught, draw: a hundred horses, or else seven, numerous.
13.2.7 Mount (''adhi-sthā''), O sun, thine easy-running chariot, rich in rays, pleasant, well-horsed, powerful (? ''vājín''), which thy yellow steeds, of excellent draught, draw: a hundred horses, or else seven, numerous.
13.2.8 The sun hath yoked in his chariot, in order to go, his seven great yellow steeds, golden-skinned; the bright one hath been freed from the dimness (? ''rájas'') in the distance; shaking away the darkness, the god hath mounted the sky.
13.2.9 The god hath come up with great show (''ketú''); he hath wasted away the darkness, hath set up (''abhi-çri'') the light; that hero, heavenly eagle, son of Aditi, hath looked abroad unto all beings.
13.2.10 Rising, thou extendest thy rays; thou adornest thyself with all forms; thou illuminest (''vi-bhā'') with might (? ''krátu'') both oceans, encompassing all worlds, shining.
13.2.11 They two move on one after the other by magic; two playing young ones go about the ocean; the one looks abroad upon all beings; yellow steeds draw the other with golden [trappings?].
13.2.12 Atri maintained thee in the sky, O sun, to make the month; thou goest well-maintained, heating, looking down upon all things that exist.
13.2.13 Thou rushest alike (? ''sam-ṛṣ'') to both borders, as a calf to two joint mothers; surely (''nanú''), that ''bráhman'' yon gods have long known.
13.2.14 What is set (''çritá'') along the ocean, that the sun desires to gain (''san''); great is stretched out his road, which is both eastern and western.
13.2.15 That one he attains completely (''sam-āp'') with his swiftnesses; that he desires not to neglect (? ''apa-cikits''); by that [men] do not appropriate the gods' draught of immortality (''amṛ́ta'').
13.2.16 This heavenly Jātavedas the lights (''ketú'') draw (''vah'') up, for every one to see the sun.
13.2.17 Away go, like thieves, these asterisms with their rays (''aktú''), for the all-beholding sun.
13.2.18 The lights (''ketú''), the rays of him have been seen abroad among the peoples, like shining fires.
13.2.19 Speedy, conspicuous to all, light-making art thou, O sun; thou shinest unto everything, O bright space (''rocaná'').
13.2.20 In front of the clans of the gods, in front of those of men thou risest; in front of every one, for seeing the sky (''svàr'').
13.2.21 With whom [as] eye thou, O purifying Varuṇa, seest him that busies himself among the people (''jánān'').
13.2.22 Thou goest through the sky, the broad welkin (''rájas''), fashioning (''mā'') the day with [thy] rays, seeing the generations (''jánman''), O sun.
13.2.23 Seven yellow steeds, O heavenly sun, draw in the chariot thee the flame-haired, the out-looking.
13.2.24 The sun hath yoked the seven neat (''çundhyú'') daughters of the chariot; with them, [who are] self-yoked, he goeth.
13.2.25 The ruddy one hath mounted the sky with penance, [he] rich in penance; he comes to the womb (''yóni''), he is born again; he hath become over-lord of the gods.
13.2.26 He who belongs to all men (''-carṣaṇí'') and has faces on all sides, who has hands on all sides and palms on all sides - he brings together with his (two) arms, together with his wings (pl.), generating heaven-and-earth, sole god.
13.2.27 The one-footed strode out more than the two-footed; the two-footed falls upon (''abhi-i'') the three-footed from behind; the two-footed strode out more than the six-footed; they sit together [about] the body of the one-footed.
13.2.28 When, about to go unwearied, he hath approached (''ā-sthā'') his yellow steeds, he, shining (''ruc''), makes for himself two forms; rising rich in lights (''ketú-''), overpowering the dim spaces (''rájas''), thou illuminest (''vi-bhā''), O Āditya, all the advances.
13.2.29 Verily (''báṭ''), great art thou, O sun; verily, O Āditya, great art thou; great is the greatness of thee the great one; thou, O Āditya, art great.
13.2.30 Thou shinest (''ruc'') in the sky, thou shinest in the atmosphere, O flying one; on the earth thou shinest, thou shinest within the waters; both oceans thou hast penetrated (''vi-āp'') with thy sheen (''rúci''); a god, O god, art thou, a heaven-conquering bull (''mahiṣá'').
13.2.31 Hitherward from afar, extended (''pra-yam'') in mid-route, swift, inspired, flying, he the flying one, perceived (? ''vícitta'') [as] Vishṇu, surpassing (''adhi-sthā'') with strength - he overpowers with his show (''ketú'') all that stirs.
13.2.32 Wondrous, understanding (''cikitvāṅs''), a bull (''mahiṣá''), an eagle, making to shine the two firmaments (''ródasī''), the atmosphere - day-and-night, clothing themselves about with the sun, lengthen out all his heroisms.
13.2.33 Keen (''tigmá''), shining out (''vi-bhrāj''), sharpening himself, granting the helpful (? ''araṁgamá'') advances, a winged one full of light, a vigor-bestowing bull (''mahiṣá''), he hath approached (''ā-sthā'') all the directions, arranging (''kḷp'').
13.2.34 Wondrous front [and] show (''ketú'') of the gods, the sun, full of light, going up the directions (''pradíç''), the day-maker, bright (''çukrá''), hath overpassed with brightnesses (''dyumná'') the glooms (''támas'') [and] all difficulties.
13.2.35 The wondrous front of the gods hath arisen, the eye of Mitra, of Varuṇa, of Agni; he hath filled heaven-and-earth, the atmosphere; the sun is the soul of the moving creation (''jágat'') and of the stationary (''tasthivā́ṅs'').
13.2.36 Flying on high (''uccā́''), the red eagle, in the midst of the sky hasting, shining - may we see thee, whom men call the impeller (''savitṛ́''), the unfailing light which Atri found.
13.2.37 To the eagle running on the back of the sky, to the son of Aditi, I, frightened, approach (''upa-yā''), desiring refuge; do thou, O sun, lengthen out for us a long life-time; may we take no harm; may we be in thy favor.
13.2.38 A thousand days' journey are expanded the wings of him, of the yellow swan flying to heaven; he, putting all the gods in his breast, goes viewing together all existences.
13.2.39 The ruddy one became time, the ruddy one in the beginning Prajāpati; the ruddy one [is] face (mouth?) of the sacrifices; the ruddy one brought the bright sky (''svàr'').
13.2.40 The ruddy one became the world; the ruddy one overheated the sky; the ruddy one with his rays goes about over the earth, the ocean.
13.2.41 All the quarters did the ruddy one, over-lord of the sky, go about upon; the sky, the ocean, also the earth - all that exists doth he defend.
13.2.42 He, mounting, glowing [and] unwearied, the great [spaces], makes for himself, shining (''ruc''), two forms; wondrous, understanding, bull, wind-going (??), when he shines out (''vi-bhā'') upon as many worlds [as there are].
13.2.43 The one he falls upon (''abhi-i''), the other he casts about - the bull, arranging with day-and-night; we, imploring, call upon the track-finding sun, dwelling in the welkin (''rájas'').
13.2.44 The earth-filling bull (''mahiṣá''), track of the implorer, of undamaged sight, hath encompassed the all; beholding (''sam-paç'') the all, beneficent, reverend, let him hear this which I say.
13.2.45 The greatness of him exceeds (''pári'') the earth, the ocean; shining abroad with light, it exceeds (''pári'') the sky, the atmosphere; beholding the all, beneficent, reverend, let him hear this which I say.
13.2.46 Agni hath been awakened by the kindling of men to meet the dawn coming like a milch-cow; like young (''yahvá'') [birds?] rising forth to a branch, the lights (''bhānú'') go forth unto the firmament (''nā́ka'').

;;; 1 Marriage ceremonies.
14.1.1 By truth is the earth established (''ut-stabh''); by the sun is the sky established; by righteousness the Ādityas stand; Soma is set (''çritá'') upon the sky.
14.1.2 By Soma are the Ādityas strong; by Soma is the earth great; likewise in the lap of these asterisms is Soma placed (''ā-dhā'').
14.1.3 One thinks himself to have drunk Soma when they crush up an herb; what Soma the priests (''brahmán'') know, of that no earthly man partakes.
14.1.4 When, O Soma, they drink thee up, then thou fillest thyself up again; Vāyu is Soma's defender; the month is norm (''ā́kṛti'') of the years (''sámā'').
14.1.5 Guarded by covering-arrangements, defended by watchmen (?? ''bárhata''), O Soma, thou standest hearing the pressing-stones; no earthly one partakes of thee.
14.1.6 Intention (''cítti'') was the pillow, sight was the ointment, heaven [and] earth were the coffer (''kóça''), when Sūryā went to her husband.
14.1.7 The ''rāíbhī'' was the parting [song] (?? ''anudéyī''), the ''nārāçaṅsī́'' was the welcoming one (? ''nyócanī''); Sūryā's garment verily was excellent; she goes adorned with song (''gā́thā'').
14.1.8 The laudations (''stóma'') were the cross-pieces (?? ''pratidhí''); meter was the ''kurī́ra'', the ''opaçá;'' of Sūryā the Açvins were the wooers, Agni was the forerunner.
14.1.9 Soma was the bride-seeker; both Açvins were wooers, when Savitar gave to her husband Sūryā, praising (''çaṅs'') with her mind.
14.1.10 Mind was her cart; heaven also was [its] canopy; the two draft-oxen were white (''çukrá''), when Sūryā went to her husband.
14.1.11 Haltered with verse (''ṛ́c'') and chant (''sā́man''), thy two oxen went peaceful (? ''sāmaná''); ears were thy (two) wheels; in the sky the wandering track.
14.1.12 Clean were the (two) wheels of thee as thou wentest; out-breathing (''vyāná'') was the inserted axle; a cart made of mind did Sūryā ascend when going forth to her husband.
14.1.13 The bridal (''vahatú'') of Sūryā, which Savitar sent off (''ava-sṛj''), has gone forth; in the Maghās are slain the kine; in the Phalgunīs is the wedding.
14.1.14 When, O Açvins, ye went asking, with your three-wheeled [chariot], to Sūryā's bridal, where was one wheel of yours? where stood ye for pointing out?
14.1.15 When ye went, O lords of beauty, unto the wooing of Sūryā, all the gods assented to that [deed] of yours; Pūshan as son chose a father.
14.1.16 The two wheels of thee, O Sūryā, the priests (''brahmán'') know seasonably; further, the one wheel that is in secret - that, verily, the enlightened (''addhātí'') know.
14.1.17 We make offering to Aryaman of good connections, husband-finder; like a gourd from its bond, from here I release, not from yonder.
14.1.18 I release [her] from here, not from yonder; I make her well-bound yonder, that she, O gracious Indra, may be rich in sons, well-portioned.
14.1.19 I release thee from Varuṇa's fetter, with which the very propitious Savitar bound thee; in the lair (''yóni'') of righteousness, in the world of the well-done, be it pleasant for thee accompanied by the wooer (''-sambhalá'').
14.1.20 Let Bhaga lead thee hence, grasping thy hand; let the Açvins carry thee forth by a chariot; go to the houses, that thou mayest be housewife; thou, having control, shalt speak unto the council.
14.1.21 Let what is dear succeed (''sam-ṛdh'') here for thy progeny; watch thou over this house in order to housewife-ship; mingle thy self (''tanū́'') with this husband; then shalt thou in advanced age speak to the council.
14.1.22 Be ye (two) just here; be not separated; attain your whole lifetime, sporting with sons [and] grandsons, rejoicing, well-homed.
14.1.23 These two move on one after the other by magic; two sporting young ones go about the ocean; the one looks abroad upon all beings; thou, the other, disposing the seasons art born new.
14.1.24 Ever new art thou, being born; sign of the days, thou goest to the apex of the dawns; thou disposest to the gods their share as thou comest; thou extendest, O moon, a long life-time.
14.1.25 Give thou away the ''çāmulyà;'' share out goods to the priests (''brahmán''); it, becoming a walking (''padvánt'') witchcraft, enters the husband [as] a wife.
14.1.26 It becomes blue-red; [as] witchcraft, infection, it is driven away (?); her relations (''jñātí'') thrive; her husband is bound in bonds.
14.1.27 Unlovely becomes [his] body, glistening in that evil way, when the husband wraps his own member with the bride's garment.
14.1.28 Carving on, carving open, also cutting over apart; see the forms of Sūryā; them also the priest (''brahmán'') cleans (''çumbh'').
14.1.29 Harsh is that, sharp, barbed, poisoned; that is not to be eaten; what priest (''brahmán'') knows Sūryā, he indeed deserves the bride's [garment].
14.1.30 That priest verily takes this garment, pleasant, well-omened, who goes over the expiation, by whom the wife takes no harm.
14.1.31 Do ye (two) bring together a successful (''sámṛddha'') portion, speaking right in right-speakings; O Brahmaṇaspati, make the husband shine (''ruc'') for her; let the wooer (''sambhalá'') speak this speech agreeably (''cā́ru'').
14.1.32 May ye be just here; may ye not go away; may ye, O kine, increase this man with progeny; going in beauty, ruddy, with soma-splendor - may all the gods turn (''kṛ'') your minds hither.
14.1.33 May ye, O kine, enter this man together with progeny; this man minisheth (''mī'') not the share of the gods; for this man shall Pūshan, and all the Maruts, for this man shall Dhātar, Savitar quicken (''sū'') you.
14.1.34 Free from thorns, straight, let the roads be by which [our] comrades go a-wooing for us; together with Bhaga, together with Aryaman - let Dhātar unite [us] with splendor.
14.1.35 Both what splendor is placed in dice, and what in strong drink - what splendor, O Açvins, is in kine, with that splendor favor (''av'') ye this woman.
14.1.36 With what [splendor] the backsides of the courtezan (''mahānagnī́''), O Açvins, or with what the strong drink, with what the dice were flooded (''abhi-sic''), with that splendor favor ye this woman.
14.1.37 He who shines (''dī'') without fuel within the waters, whom the devout (''vípra'') praise at the sacrifices (''adhvará'') - O child of the waters, mayest thou give waters rich in honey, with which Indra increased, full of heroism.
14.1.38 Now do I remove (''apa-ūh'') the glistening seizer (''grābhá''), body-spoiling; what sheen is excellent, that I draw up (''ud-ac'').
14.1.39 Let the Brahmans take for her [water] for bathing; let them draw up (?) waters that slay not a hero; let her go about the fire of Aryaman, O Pūshan; father-in-law and brother-in-law are looking on (''prati-īkṣ'').
14.1.40 Weal be to thee gold, and weal be waters; weal be the post (''methí''), weal the perforation (''tárdman'') of the yoke; weal be for thee the waters having a hundred cleansers (''-pavítra''); for weal, too, mingle thyself with thy husband.
14.1.41 In the hole of the chariot, in the hole of the cart, in the hole of the yoke, O thou of a hundred activities, having thrice purified Apālā, O Indra, thou didst make her sun-skinned.
14.1.42 Hoping for well-willing, offspring, good-fortune, wealth, becoming obedient (''ánuvrata'') to thy husband, gird thyself in order to immortality.
14.1.43 As the mighty (? ''vṛ́ṣā'') river (''síndhu'') won (? ''sū'') the supremacy of the streams (''nadī́''), so be thou supreme (''samrā́jñī''), having gone away to thy husband's home.
14.1.44 Be thou supreme among fathers-in-law, supreme also among brothers-in-law; be thou supreme over sister-in-law, supreme also over mother-in-law.
14.1.45 They (f.) who spun, wove, and who stretched [the web], what divine ones (f.) gave the ends about, let them wrap thee in order to old age; [as] one long-lived put about thee this garment.
14.1.46 They bewail the living one (m.); they lead away the sacrifice (''adhvará''); the men sent their thoughts after root ''dhī...ánu'' a long reach (''prásiti''); what is lovely (''vāmá'') for the Fathers who came together here; joy to the husbands for embracing the wife.
14.1.47 I maintain for thee, in order to progeny, a pleasant, firm (''dhruvá'') stone in the lap of the divine earth; stand thou on that, one to be exulted after, of excellent glory; let Savitar make for thee a long life-time.
14.1.48 Wherewith Agni grasped the right hand of this earth, therewith grasp I thy hand; do not stagger in company with me, with both progeny and riches.
14.1.49 Let god Savitar grasp thy hand; let king Soma make thee to have good offspring; let Agni, Jātavedas, make the spouse well-portioned, long-lived, for her husband.
14.1.50 I grasp thy hand in order to good-fortune, that with me as husband thou mayest be long-lived; Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitar, Purandhi ''púraṁdhi'' - the gods have given thee to me in order to housewifeship.
14.1.51 Bhaga hath grasped thy hand; Savitar hath grasped thy hand; thou art [my] spouse by ordinance (''dhárman''), I thy house-lord.
14.1.52 Be this woman mine, bringing prosperity (''pósya''); Brihaspati hath given thee to me; in company with me as husband do thou live, rich in offspring, a hundred autumns.
14.1.53 Tvashṭar disposed (''vi-dhā'') the garment for beauty, by direction of Brihaspati, of the poets; therewith let Savitar and Bhaga envelop this woman, like Sūryā, with progeny.
14.1.54 Let Indra-and-Agni, heaven-and-earth, Mātariçvan, Mitra-and-Varuṇa, Bhaga, both Açvins, Brihaspati, the Maruts, the ''bráhman''. Soma, increase this woman with progeny.
14.1.55 Brihaspati first prepared (''kḷp'') the hairs on the head of Sūryā; with this, O Açvins, do we thoroughly adorn (''çubh'') this woman for her husband.
14.1.56 This [is] that form in which the young woman (''yóṣā'') dressed herself; I desire to know with [my] mind the wife (''jāyá'') moving about; I will go after her with nine-fold (? ''návagva'') comrades: who, knowing, unloosened (''vi-cṛt'') these fetters?
14.1.57 I loosen (''vi-sā'') in me the form of her; he verily shall know, seeing the nest of mind; I eat not stolenly; I was freed (''ud-muc'') by mind, myself untying (''çrath'') the fetters of Varuṇa.
14.1.58 I release thee from Varuṇa's fetter, with which the very propitious Savitar bound thee; wide space (''loká''), an easy road here, do I make for thee, O bride (''vadhū́''), with thy husband.
14.1.59 Raise ye [your weapons]; may ye smite away the demon; set this woman in what is well done; inspired Dhātar found for her a husband; let king Bhaga go in front, foreknowing.
14.1.60 Bhaga fashioned the four feet; Bhaga fashioned the four frame-pieces (? ''úṣyala''); Tvashṭar adorned (''piç'') the straps (? ''várdhra'') along in the middle; let her be to us of excellent omen.
14.1.61 The well-flowered (''sukiṅçuká''), all-formed bridal-car (''vahatú''), golden-colored, well-rolling, well-wheeled, do thou mount, O Sūryā, to the world of the immortal; make thou a bridal -car pleasant to husbands.
14.1.62 Her, not brother-slaying, O Varuṇa; not cattle-slaying, O Brihaspati; not husband-slaying, possessing sons, O Indra - bring [her] for us, O Savitar.
14.1.63 Injure ye not the maiden (''kumārī́''), ye (two) pillars, on the god-made road; the door of the divine house we make pleasant, a road for the bride.
14.1.64 Let the ''bráhman'' be yoked after, the ''bráhman'' before, the ''bráhman'' at the end, in the middle, the ''bráhman'' everywhere; going forward to an impenetrable stronghold of the gods, do thou (f.), propitious, pleasant, bear rule in thy husband's world.
;;; 2 Marriage ceremonies (continued).
14.2.1 For thee in the beginning they carried about Sūryā, together with the bridal-car; mayest thou, O Agni, give to us husbands the wife, together with progeny.
14.2.2 Agni hath given back the spouse, together with life-time, with splendor; of long life-time, may he who is the husband of her live a hundred autumns.
14.2.3 Soma's wife first; the Gandharva thy next husband; Agni thy third husband; thy fourth, one of human birth.
14.2.4 Soma gave to the Gandharva; the Gandharva gave to Agni; both wealth and sons hath Agni given to me, likewise this woman.
14.2.5 Your favor hath come, O ye (two) of abundant good things (? ''vājínīvasu''); [our] desires have rested in [your] hearts, O Açvins; ye have been twin keepers, O lords of beauty; may we, being dear, attain favorers (''aryamán'') of our homes (? ''dúrya'').
14.2.6 Do thou (f.), rejoicing with propitious mind, assign wealth having all heroes, to be extolled; an easy crossing (''tīrthá''), well provided with drink, O lords (du.) of beauty; do ye smite away the pillar standing in the road, [namely] disfavor.
14.2.7 What herbs [there are], what streams, what fields, what forests - let these, O bride, defend from the demon thee, possessing progeny, for thy husband.
14.2.8 We have mounted this road, easy, bringing welfare, on which a hero takes no harm, [but] finds others' goods.
14.2.9 Pray hear ye now of me, O men, by what blessing (''āçís'') the two spouses attain what is agreeable (''vāmá''): what Gandharvas [there are] and heavenly Apsarases, who stand upon these forest trees (''vānaspatyá''), let them be pleasant unto this bride; let them not injure the bridal-car as it is driven.
14.2.10 What ''yákṣmas'' go to the bride's brilliant (''candrá'') car among the people, let the worshipful gods conduct those back whence they came.
14.2.11 Let not the waylayers who pursue (''ā-sad'') [them] find the two spouses; let them go over what is difficult by an easy [road]; let the niggards run away.
14.2.12 I cause the bridal-car to be viewed by the houses with worship (''bráhman''), with a friendly, not terrible eye; what of all forms is fastened on about, let Savitar make that pleasant for the husbands.
14.2.13 Propitious hath this woman come to the home; Dhātar appointed this world (sphere) to her; her let Aryaman, Bhaga, both Açvins, Prajāpati, increase with progeny.
14.2.14 [As] a soulful cultivated field hath this woman come; in her here, O men, scatter ye seed; she shall give birth to progeny for you from her belly (''vakṣáṇās''), bearing the exuded (''dugdhá'') sperm of the male (''ṛṣabhá'').
14.2.15 Stand firm; ''virā́j'' art thou; as it were, Vishṇu here, O Sarasvatī; O Sinīvālī, let her have progeny; may she be in the favor of Bhaga.
14.2.16 Let your wave smite up the pegs; O waters, release the yoke-ropes (''yóktra''); let not the two inviolable [kine], not evil-doing, free from guilt, come upon what is unpropitious (? ''áçuna'').
14.2.17 With an eye not terrible, not husband-slaying, pleasant, helpful (''çagmá''), very propitious, of easy control (''suyáma'') for the houses, hero-bearing, loving brothers-in-law (?), with favoring mind - may we thrive together with thee.
14.2.18 Not brother-in-law-slaying, not husband-slaying be thou here, propitious to the cattle, of easy control, very splendid, having progeny, hero-bearing, loving brothers-in-law (?), pleasant, do thou worship (''sapary'') this householder's fire.
14.2.19 Stand up from here; desiring what hast thou (f.) come hither? I [am] thine overcomer, O Iḍā, out of [my] own house; thou that hast come hither, O perdition, seeking the empty - stand up, O niggard; fly forth; rest not here.
14.2.20 When this bride hath worshiped the householder's, the former (''pū́rva'') fire, then, O woman, do thou pay homage to Sarasvatī and to the Fathers.
14.2.21 Take this protection, defense, to spread under this woman; O Sinīvālī, let her have progeny; may she be in the favor of Bhaga.
14.2.22 What rushes (''bálbaja'') ye cast down, and [what] hide ye spread under, that let the girl (''kanyā̀'') of good progeny mount, who finds a husband.
14.2.23 Spread under the rushes upon the red hide; sitting down upon it, of good progeny, let her worship this fire.
14.2.24 Mount the hide; sit by the fire; this god slays all the demons; here give birth to progeny for this husband; may this son of thine be of good primogeniture.
14.2.25 Let there come forth (''vi-sthā'') from the lap of this mother animals (''paçú'') of various forms, being born; as one of excellent omen, sit thou by this fire; with thy husband (''sámpatnī''), be thou serviceable to the gods here.
14.2.26 Of excellent omen, extender (''pratáraṇa'') of the houses, very propitious to thy husband, wealful to thy father-in-law, pleasant to thy mother-in-law, do thou enter these houses.
14.2.27 Be thou pleasant to fathers-in-law, pleasant to husband, to houses, pleasant to all this clan; pleasant unto their prosperity (''puṣṭá'') be thou.
14.2.28 Of excellent omen is this bride; come together, see her; having given unto her good-fortune, go asunder and away with ill-fortunes.
14.2.29 What evil-hearted young women, and likewise what old ones, [are] here - do ye all ''sám'' now give splendor to her; then go asunder and away home.
14.2.30 The gold-cushioned (? ''prastaraṇa'') vehicle, bearing all forms, did Sūryā, Savitar's daughter, mount, in order to great good-fortune.
14.2.31 Mount the couch with favoring mind; here give birth to progeny for this husband; like Indrāṇī, waking with good awakening, mayest thou watch to meet dawns tipped with light.
14.2.32 The gods in the beginning lay with (''ni-pad'') their spouses; they embraced (''sam-spṛç'') bodies with bodies; like Sūryā, O woman, all-formed, with greatness, having progeny, unite (''sam-bhū'') here with thy husband.
14.2.33 Stand up from here, O Viçvāvasu; with homage do we praise thee; seek thou a sister (''jāmí'') sitting among the Fathers, inserted (? ''nyàktām''); that is thy portion by right of birth; know thou that.
14.2.34 The Apsarases revel a joint reveling, between the oblation-holder and the sun; they are thy birthplace; go away to them; homage I pay thee with the Gandharva-season.
14.2.35 Homage to the Gandharva's mind (?), and homage to his terrible (''bhā́ma'') eye we pay; O Viçvāvasu, homage [be] to thee with worship (''bráhman''); go away unto thy wives, the Apsarases.
14.2.36 With wealth may we be well-willing; we have made the Gandharva go (''vṛt'') up from here; that god hath gone to the highest station (''sadhástha''); we have gone where they lengthen out [their] life-time.
14.2.37 Unite (''sam-sṛj''), O ye (two) parents (''pitṛ́''), the (two) things that are seasonable; ye shall be mother and father of seed; as a male (''márya'') a female (''yóṣā''), do thou mount her; make ye (two) progeny; here enjoy (''puṣ'') wealth.
14.2.38 Send, O Pūshan, her, most propitious, in whom men scatter seed (''bī́ja''); who, eager, shall part our thighs; in whom we, eager, may insert the member.
14.2.39 Mount thou the thigh; apply the hand; embrace thy wife with well-willing mind; make ye (two) progeny here, enjoying; let Savitar make for you a long life-time.
14.2.40 Let Prajāpati generate progeny for you (two); let Aryaman unite (''sam-añj'') [you] with days-and-nights; not ill-omened, enter thou this world of thy husband; be weal to our bipeds, weal to [our] quadrupeds.
14.2.41 This bridal garment and bride's dress, given by the gods together with Manu, whoso gives to a knowing (''cikitvā́ṅs'') priest (''brahmán''), he verily slays the demons of the couch (?).
14.2.42 What priest's portion they (dual) give to me the bride-seeker (''vadhūyú''), the bridal garment and bride's dress, do ye, O Brihaspati and Indra, assenting, together give it to the priest (''brahmán'').
14.2.43 Awaking out of a pleasant lair (''yóni''), mightily enjoying yourselves, merry, having good kine, good sons, good houses, may ye, living, pass the outshining dawns.
14.2.44 Clothing myself anew, fragrant, well-dressed, I have risen alive unto the outshining dawns; as a bird from the egg, I have been released out of all sin.
14.2.45 Beautiful [are] heaven-and-earth, pleasant near by, of great courses; seven divine waters have flowed; let them free us from distress.
14.2.46 Unto Sūryā, unto the gods, unto Mitra and Varuṇa, unto them who are forethoughtful of that which exists, have I paid this homage.
14.2.47 He who, without a clamp (? ''abhiçríṣ''), before the piercing of the neck-ropes (? ''jatrú''), combines (''sam-dhā'') a combination - he the bountiful, the one of much good - removes again what is spoiled (''víhruta'').
14.2.48 Away from us let the darkness shine (''vas''), that is deep blue, brown (''piçán̄ga''), also red; she who is consuming, spotted, her I fasten (''ā-saj'') on this pillar.
14.2.49 How many witchcrafts in the outer garment (? ''upavā́sana''), how many fetters of king Varuṇa, what failures, what non-successes - them I cause to sit upon this pillar.
14.2.50 What is my dearest self (''tanū́''), that of me is afraid of the garment; of it do thou, O forest-lord, make first (''ágre'') for thyself an inner wrap (''nīví''); let us not suffer harm.
14.2.51 What ends [there are], how many edges (''síc''), what webs, and what lines; what garment woven by the spouses - may that touch us pleasantly.
14.2.52 Eager, these young girls, going to a husband from the father's world, have let go the consecration: hail!
14.2.53 Her, let go by Brihaspati, all the gods maintained; what splendor is entered into the kine, with that do we unite this woman.

14.2.60 If this daughter of thine has wailed with loosened hair (''vikeçá'') in thy house, doing evil with wailing - from that sin etc. etc.
14.2.61 If (''yát'') sisters (''jāmí''), if young women, have danced together in thy house, doing evil with wailing - from that sin etc. etc.
14.2.62 If in thy progeny, in thy cattle, or in thy houses is settled (''ni-sthā'') any evil done by the evil-doers - from that sin etc. etc.
14.2.63 This woman, scattering shrivelled grains (''pū́lya'') appeals: be my husband long-lived; may he live a hundred autumns.
14.2.64 Here, O Indra, do thou push together these two spouses like two ''cakravākás;'' let them, with [their] progeny, well-homed, live out all their life-time.
14.2.65 What is done on the chair (''āsandī́''), on the cushion (''upadhā́na''), or what on the covering (''upavā́sana''); what witchcraft they have made at the wedding (''vivāhá'') - that do we deposit in the bath.
14.2.66 What ill deed, what pollution at the wedding, and what on the bridal car - that difficulty do we wipe off on the dress (''kambalá'') of the wooer.
14.2.67 Having settled the defilement on the wooer, the difficulty on the dress, we have become worshipful, cleansed (''çudh''); may he extend our life-times.
14.2.68 The artificial hundred-toothed comb (?) that is here shall scratch away the defilement of the hair of her, away that of her head.
14.2.69 Away from every limb of her do we deposit the ''yákṣma;'' let that not attain (''pra-āp'') the earth nor the gods; let it not attain the heaven, the wide atmosphere; let that defilement not attain the waters, O Agni; let it not attain Yama and all the Fathers.
14.2.70 I gird thee with the milk of the earth; I gird thee with the milk of the herbs; I gird thee with progeny, with riches; do thou, being girded, win (''ā-san'') this strength (? ''vā́ja'').
14.2.71 He am I, she thou; chant am I, verse thou; heaven I, earth thou; let us (two) come together here; let us generate progeny.
14.2.72 The unmarried of us seek a wife, the liberal seek a son; may we (two), with uninjured life-breath, be companions (''sac''), in order to what is great, to winning of strength (? ''vā́ja-'').
14.2.73 What bride-beholding Fathers have come to this bridal-car, let them bestow on this bride, with her husband, protection accompanied with progeny.
14.2.74 She who hath come hither before, girdling herself (?), having given to this woman here progeny and property - her let them carry along the road of what is not gone; this one, a ''virā́j'', having good progeny, hath conquered.
14.2.75 Continue thou awake, waking with good awakening, unto length of life of a hundred autumns; go to the houses that thou mayest be house-mistress; let Savitar make for thee a long life-time.

From that we disportion him yonder: so-and-so, of such-and-such lineage, son of such-and-such mother, who is yonder; 32. let him not be released from the fetter, the shackle of death. 33. Of him now I involve the splendor, brilliancy, breath, life-time; now I make him fall downward.

16.9.1 Ours [is] what is conquered, ours what has shot up; I have withstood all fighters, niggards.

;;; 1 Prayer and praise to Indra and the Sun.
17.1.1 Indra of mighty power, overpowering, having overpowered, very powerful, overpowering, power-winning (''saho-jít''), heaven-winning, kine-winning, booty-winning, to be praised (''īḍ''), by name, do I call: may I be long-lived.

17.1.7 Arise, arise, O sun; arise upon me with splendor; both those whom I see and those whom I do not - among them make thou favor for me. Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.8 Let them not damage thee in the sea, within the waters - they who approach there having fetters; quitting imprecation, thou hast ascended that sky; be thou then gracious to us; may we be in thy favor. - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.9 Do thou, O Indra, in order to great good-fortune, protect us about with unharmed rays. - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.10 Do thou, O Indra, with propitious aids, be most wealful to us - ascending to the triple heaven of the heaven (''dív''), besung unto soma-drinking, having a dear abode (''-dhā́man'') unto well-being. - Thine, O Vishnu etc. etc.
17.1.11 Thou, O Indra, art all-conquering, all-gaining (''sarva-víd''); much invoked [art] thou, O Indra; do thou, O Indra, send onward this well-invoking praise; be thou gracious to us; may we be in thy favor. - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.12 Unharmed in the heaven (''dív''), also on earth, art thou; they have not attained thy greatness in the atmosphere; increasing with unharmed worship (''bráhman''), do thou there, O Indra, being in the heaven (''dív''), bestow protection (''çárman'') on us. - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.13 What body of thine, O Indra, is in the waters, what on the earth, what within the fire; what of thine, O Indra, is in the heaven-gaining (''svarvíd'') purifying one (''pávamāna''); with what body, O Indra, thou didst permeate (''vi-āp'') the atmosphere - with that body, O Indra, bestow thou protection upon us. - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.14 Increasing thee, O Indra, with worship (''bráhman''), the imploring seers have sat down [for] the session (''sattrá''). - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.15 Thou goest about Tṛita (?), thou about the fountain of a thousand streams, the heaven-gaining council. - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.16 Thou defendest the four directions; thou shinest abroad with brightness (''çocis'') unto the two firmaments (''nábhas''); thou pursuest (''anusthā'') all these beings; thou, knowing, followest (''anu-i'') the way of righteousness. - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.17 With five thou heatest upward (''párān̄''), with one hitherward; thou goest driving off the imprecation in good weather (''sudína''). - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.18 Thou art Indra, thou great Indra, thou the world, thou Prajāpati; for thee the sacrifice is extended; to thee the offerers make oblation. - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.19 In the non-existent is the existent made firm; in the existent is being (''bhūtá'') made firm; being is set in what is to be; what is to be is made firm in being. Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.20 Brilliant (''çukrá'') art thou; shiny art thou; as thou art shiny by the shining one (''bhrā́jant''), so may I by the shining one shine.
17.1.21 Brightness art thou, bright art thou; as thou by brightness art bright, so may I by both cattle and Brahman-splendor be bright (''ruc'').
17.1.22 To the rising one be obeisance; to the one coming up be obeisance; to the arisen one be obeisance; to the wide ruler (''virā́j'') be obeisance; to the self-ruler (''svarā́j'') be obeisance; to the universal ruler (''samrā́j'') be obeisance.
17.1.23 To the setting one be obeisance; to the one about to set be obeisance; to the one that has set be obeisance; to the wide ruler be obeisance; to the self-ruler be obeisance; to the universal ruler be obeisance.
17.1.24 This Āditya hath arisen, together with all ardor (''tápas''), making subject to me my rivals; and let me not be subject to my hater. - Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.
17.1.25 O Āditya, thou hast ascended a boat of a hundred oars in order to well-being; thou hast made me to pass over the day, make thou me likewise (''satrā́'') to pass over the night.

17.1.29 Guarded by righteousness and by all the seasons, guarded by what is and by what is to be am I; let not evil attain me, nor death; I interpose with a sea of speech.
17.1.30 Let Agni [as] guardian protect me all about; let the sun, rising, thrust [away] the fetters of death; out-shining dawns, firm mountains - let a thousand breaths abide (''ā-yat'') in me.
;;; 1 Funeral verses.
18.1.1 Unto a friend would I turn with friendship; having gone through much ocean, may the pious one take a grandson of [his] father, considering further onward upon the earth (''kṣám'').
18.1.2 Thy friend wants (''vaç'') not that friendship of thine, that she of like sign should become of diverse form; the sons of the great Asura, heroes, sustainers of the sky (''dív''), look widely about.
18.1.3 Truly those immortals want that - posterity (? ''tyajás'') of the one mortal; may thy mind be set in our mind; mayest thou enter [as] husband a wife's body.
18.1.4 What we (pl.) did not do formerly, why [do that] now? speaking righteousness, should we prate unrighteousness? The Gandharva in the waters and the watery woman (''yóṣā'') - that is our (du.) union (''nā́bhi''), that our du. highest relation (''jāmí'').
18.1.5 Verily, the generator made us (du.) in the womb man and spouse - god Tvashṭar, Savitar of all forms; none overthrow (''pra-mī'') his ordinances (''vratá''); earth knows us two as such, also heaven.
18.1.6 Who yokes to the pole today the kine of righteousness, the diligent, the bright, the slow to wrath (? ''durhṛṇāyú''), that have arrows in the mouth, that shoot at the heart, amiable ones? whoso shall prosper their burden, he shall live.
18.1.7 Who knows of that first day? who saw it? who shall proclaim it here? Great is the ordinance (''dhā́man'') of Mitra, of Varuṇa; why, O lustful one, wilt thou speak to men with deceit (? ''vī́ci'')?
18.1.8 Desire of Yama hath come unto me Yamī, in order to lying together in the same lair (''yóni''); I would fain yield (''ric'') my body, as wife to husband; may we whirl off, like two chariot wheels.
18.1.9 They stand not, they wink not, those spies of the gods who go about here; with another than me, O lustful one, go quickly; with him whirl off like two chariot wheels.
18.1.10 By nights, by days one may pay reverence (''daçasy'') to him; the sun's eye may open (? ''ún mimīyāt'') for a moment; with heaven, with earth paired, of near connection; - Yamī must bear the unbrotherly (''ájāmi'') [conduct] of Yama.
18.1.11 Verily there shall come those later ages (''yugá'') in which next of kin (''jāmí'') shall do what is unkinly ''ájāmi''. Put thine arm underneath a hero (''vṛṣabhá''); seek, O fortunate one, another husband than me.
18.1.12 What should brother be when there is no protector? or what sister, when destruction impends (''ni-gam'')? Impelled by desire, I prate thus much; mingle thou thy body with my body.
18.1.13 I am not thy protector here, O Yamī; I may not mingle my body with thy body; with another than me do thou prepare enjoyments; thy brother wants not that, O fortunate one.
18.1.14 Verily, I may not mingle my body with thy body; they call him wicked (''pāpá'') who should approach his sister. That is not consonant (? ''asaṁyát'') with my mind [and] heart, that I, a brother, should lie in a sister's bed (''çáyana'').
18.1.15 A weakling (? ''batá''), alas, art thou, O Yama; we have not found mind and heart thine; verily, another woman shall embrace thee, as a girth a harnessed [horse], as a twining plant (''líbujā'') a tree.
18.1.16 Another man, truly, O Yamī, another man shall embrace thee, as a twining plant a tree; either do thou seek his mind or he thine; then make for thyself very excellent concord (''samvíd'').
18.1.17 Three meters the poets extended (? ''vi-yat'') - the many-formed one, the admirable, the all-beholding; waters, winds, herbs - these are set (''ā́rpita'') in one being (''bhúvana'').
18.1.18 The bull yieldeth (''duh'') milks for the bull with the milking of the sky (''dív''), he the unharmable son (? ''yahvá'') of Aditi; everything knoweth he, like Varuṇa, by thought (''dhī́''); he, sharing the sacrifice (''yajñíya''), sacrificeth to the seasons that share the sacrifice.
18.1.19 Prateth the Gandharvī and watery woman; in the noise of the noisy one (''nadá'') let [her] protect our mind; let Aditi set us in the midst of what is desired (? ''iṣṭá''); our oldest brother shall first speak out.
18.1.20 She now, the excellent, rich in food, full of glory - the dawn hath shone for man (''mánu''), full of light (''svàr-''); since they have generated for the council [as] ''hótṛ'' Agni, the eager one, after the will (''krátu'') of the eager ones.
18.1.21 Then that mighty (''vibhū́'') conspicuous drop did the bird, the lively falcon, bring at the sacrifice; if the Aryan tribes (''víç'') choose the wondrous one, Agni, [as] ''hótṛ'', then prayer (''dhī́'') was born.
18.1.22 Ever art thou pleasant (''raṇvá''), as pastures to him that enjoys (''puṣ'') them, being, O Agni, well sacrificed to with the offerings of man (''mánus''); or when, active, praiseworthy, having won the strength (''vā́ja'') of the inspired one (''vípra''), thou approachest with very many.
18.1.23 Send thou up the (two) fathers, [as] a lover, unto enjoyment (''bhága''). The welcome one (''haryatá'') desires to sacrifice; he sends from the heart; the bearer (''váhni'') speaks out; the merry one (? ''makhá'') does a good work; the Asura shows might (''taviṣy''); he trembles with purpose (? ''matī́'').
18.1.24 Whatever mortal hath seen thy favor, O Agni, son of power, he is renowned exceedingly; acquiring (''dhā'') food (''íṣ''), borne by horses, he, lightful, vigorous, passes (? ''ā-bhūṣ'') the days (''dív'').
18.1.25 Hear us, O Agni, in thy seat, thy station; harness the speedy chariot of the immortal (''amṛ́ta''); bring to us the two firmaments (''ródasī''), parents of the gods; be thou of the gods never (''mā́kis'') away; mayest thou be here.
18.1.26 That, O Agni, this meeting may take place (''bhū''), divine, among the gods, worshipful, thou reverend one, and that thou mayest share out treasures, O self-ruling one, do thou enjoy here our portion filled with good things.
18.1.27 Agni hath looked after the apex of the dawns, after the days, [he] first, Jātavedas; a sun, after the dawns, after the rays; after heaven-and-earth he entered.
18.1.28 Agni hath looked forth to meet the apex of the dawns, to meet the days, [he] first, Jātavedas, and to meet the rays of the sun in many places; to meet heaven-and-earth he stretched out.
18.1.29 Heaven and earth, first by right, truth-speaking, are within hearing, when the god, making mortals to sacrifice, sits as ''hótṛ'', going to meet his own being (''ásu'').
18.1.30 A god, encompassing the gods with right, carry thou first our offering, understanding [it]; smoke-bannered by the fuel, light-beaming, a pleasant, constant ''hótṛ'', skilled sacrificer with speech.
18.1.31 I praise (''arc'') your (du.) work unto increase, ye ghee-surfaced ones; O heaven-and-earth, hear me, ye two firmaments (''ródasī''); when days, O gods, went to the other life (''ásunīti''), let the two parents (''pitárā'') sharpen us here with honey.
18.1.32 If the god's immortality (''amṛ́ta'') is easy to appropriate for the cow, thence those who are born maintain themselves on the broad [earth]; all the gods go after that sacrificial formula of thine, when the hind yields (''duh'') the ghee, heavenly liquor (''vā́r'').
18.1.33 Why forsooth hath the king seized (''grah'') us? what have we done in transgression of (''áti'') his ordinance (''vratá'')? who discerns [it]? for even Mitra, swerving the gods, like a song of praise (''çlóka''), is the might also of them that go.
18.1.34 Hard to reverence (? ''durmántu'') here is the name of the immortal, that she of like sign should become of diverse form; whoso shall reverence Yama with proper reverence (? ''sumántu''), him, O Agni, exalted one, do thou protect, unremitting.
18.1.35 In whom the gods revel at the council, maintain themselves in Vivasvant's seat - they placed light in the sun, rays in the moon: the two, unfailing, wait upon (''pari-car'') the brightness (''dyotaní'').
18.1.36 In what secret (''apīcyà'') devotion (''mánman'') the gods go about (''sam-car'') - we know it not; may Mitra, may Aditi, may god Savitar declare us here guiltless to Varuṇa.
18.1.37 O companions, we would supplicate (''ā-ças'') worship (''bráhman'') for Indra, possessor of the thunderbolt, to praise, indeed, the most manly, the daring.
18.1.38 For thou art famed for might (''çávas''), for Vritra-slaying, a Vritra-slayer; thou out-bestowest the bounteous with thy bounties, O hero.
18.1.39 Thou goest over the earth as a ''stegá'' over the ground; let winds blow here on the great earth (''bhū́mi'') for us; Mitra for us there (''átra''), Varuṇa, being joined, hath let loose heat (''çóka''), as fire does in the forest.
18.1.40 Praise thou the famed sitter on the hollow of men (''jána''), the terrible king, formidable assailant (? ''upahatnú''); being praised, O Rudra, be gracious to the singer; let thine army (? ''sénya'') lay low (''ni-vap'') another than us.
18.1.41 On Sarasvatī do the pious call; on Sarasvatī , while the sacrifice is being extended; on Sarasvatī do the well-doers call: may Sarasvatī give what is desirable to the worshiper (''dāçvā́ṅs'').
18.1.42 On Sarasvatī do the Fathers call, arriving at the sacrifice on the south; sitting on this ''barhís'' do ye revel; assign thou to us food (''íṣas'') free from disease.
18.1.43 O Sarasvatī, that wentest in company (''sarátham'') with the songs (''ukthá''), with the ''svadhā́s'', O goddess, reveling with the Fathers, assign thou to the sacrificer here a portion of refreshment (''íḍ'') of thousandfold value, abundance of wealth.
18.1.44 Let the lower, let the higher, let the midmost Fathers, the soma-drinking (? ''somyá''), go up; they who went to life (''ásu''), unharmed (''avṛká''), right-knowing - let those Fathers aid us at our calls.
18.1.45 I have won hither (''ā-vid'') the beneficent Fathers, both the grandson and the wide-striding of Vishṇu; they who, sitting on the ''barhís'', partake of the pressed drink with ''svadhā́'' - they come especially hither.
18.1.46 Be this homage today to the Fathers, who went first, who went after, who are seated in the space (''rájas'') of earth, or who are now in regions (''díç'') having good abodes (''suvṛjána'').
18.1.47 Mātālī with the ''kavyás'', Yama with the An̄girases, Brihaspati increasing with the ''ṛ́kvans'' ('praisers'); both they whom the gods increased and who [increased] the gods - let those Fathers aid us at our calls.
18.1.48 Sweet verily is this [''sóma''], and full of honey is this; strong (''tīvrá'') verily is this, and full of sap is this; and no one soever overpowers in conflicts (''āhavá'') Indra, having now drunk of it.
18.1.49 Him that went away to the advances called great, spying out the road for many, Vivasvant's son, gatherer of people, king Yama, honor (''sapary'') ye with oblation.
18.1.50 Yama first found for us a track (''gātú''); that is not a pasture to be borne away; where our former Fathers went forth, there (''enā́'') [go] those born [of them], along their own roads.
18.1.51 Ye ''barhís''-seated Fathers, hitherward with aid! these offerings have we made for you; enjoy [them]! do ye come with most wealful aid; then assign to us weal [and] profit, free from evil.
18.1.52 Bending the knee, sitting down on the right, let all assent to (''abhi-gṛ'') this libation of ours; injure us not, O Fathers, by reason of any offense (''ā́gas'') which we may do to you through humanity.
18.1.53 Tvashṭar makes a wedding-car for his daughter; by reason of this, all this creation comes together; the mother of Yama, wife of great Vivasvant, being drawn about, disappeared.
18.1.54 Go thou forth, go forth by roads that go to the stronghold (''pūryā́ṇa''), as (''yénā'') thy Fathers of old went forth; both kings, reveling with ''svadhā́'', shalt thou see, Yama and god Varuṇa.
18.1.55 Go ye away, go asunder, and creep apart from here; for this man the Fathers have made this world; adorned with days, with waters, with rays (''aktú''), a rest (''avasā́na'') Yama gives to him.
18.1.56 Eager (''uçánt'') would we light thee, eager would we kindle; do thou, eager, bring the eager Fathers to eat the oblation.
18.1.57 Lightful (''dyumánt'') would we light thee, lightful would we kindle; do thou, lightful, bring the lightful Fathers to eat the oblation.
18.1.58 The An̄girases, our ''návagva'' Fathers, the Atharvans, the Bhṛigus, soma-drinkers (''somyá'') - may we be in the favor of those worshipful ones, likewise in their excellent well-willing.
18.1.59 Come thou hither with the worshipful An̄girases; revel here, O Yama, with the Vāirūpas - I call Vivasvant, who is thy father - sitting down upon this ''barhís''.
18.1.60 Ascend thou, O Yama, this cushion (''prastará''), in concord with the An̄giras Fathers; let the sacred utterances (''mántra'') made in praise by the poets bring thee; then (''enā́''), O king, revel thou in the oblation.
18.1.61 These ascended up from here; they ascended the backs of the sky (''dív''); the An̄girases have gone forth to heaven (''dív''), like ''bhūrjís'', by the road.

18.2.1 For Yama the soma purifies itself; for Yama is made the oblation; to Yama goes the sacrifice, messengered by Agni, made satisfactory.
18.2.2 Offer ye to Yama what is most honeyed, and stand forth; this homage to the former-born, the former, the path-making seers.
18.2.3 Unto Yama the king offer ye an oblation, milk rich in ghee; he furnishes (''ā-yam'') to us among the living a long life-time, for living on.
18.2.4 Do not, O Agni, burn him up; do not be hot upon (''abhi-çuc'') him; do not warp (''kṣip'') his skin, nor his body; when thou shalt make him done, O Jātavedas, then send him forward unto the Fathers.
18.2.5 When thou shalt make him done, O Jātavedas, then commit him to the Fathers; when he shall go to that other life (''ásunīti''), then shall he become a controller (? ''vaçanī́'') of the gods.
18.2.6 With the ''trikadrukas'' it purifies itself; six wide ones, verily one great one; ''triṣṭúbh'', ''gāyatrī́'', the meters: all those [are] set in Yama.
18.2.7 Go thou to the sun with thine eye, to the wind with thy soul (''ātmán''); go both to heaven and to earth with [their] due shares (? ''dhárman''); or go to the waters, if there it is acceptable (''hitá'') to thee; in the herbs stand firm with thy bodies.
18.2.8 The goat is the share of the heat (''tápas''); heat thou that; that let thine ardor (''çocís'') heat, that thy flame (''arcís''); what propitious bodies (''tanū́'') are thine, O Jātavedas, with them carry him to the world of the well-doing.
18.2.9 What ardors (''çocí''), swiftnesses (''ráṅhi'') are thine, O Jātavedas, with which thou fillest the sky, the atmosphere, let them collect (''sam-ṛ'') after the goat as he goes; then with other most propitious ones make him propitious.
18.2.10 Release again, O Agni, to the Fathers him who goes (''car'') offered to thee, with ''svadhā́;'' clothing himself in life (''ā́yus''), let him go unto [his] posterity (? ''çéṣas''); let him be united with a body, very splendid.
18.2.11 Run thou past the two four-eyed, brindled dogs of Saramā, by a happy (''sādhú'') road; then go unto the beneficent Fathers, who revel in common revelry with Yama.
18.2.12 What two defending dogs thou hast, O Yama, four-eyed, sitting by the road, men-watching, with them, O king, do thou surround him; assign to him well-being and freedom from disease.
18.2.13 Broad-nosed, feeding on lives (? ''asutṛ́p''), copper-colored, Yama's two messengers go about after men (''jána''); let them give us back here today excellent life (''ásu''), to see the sun.
18.2.14 Soma purifies itself for some; some wait upon (''upa-ās'') ghee; for whom honey runs forward (?), unto them do thou go.
18.2.15 They who of old were won by right, born of right, increasers of right - to the seers rich in fervor (''tápas-''), born of fervor, O Yama, do thou go.
18.2.16 They who by fervor are unassailable, who by fervor have gone to heaven (''svàr''), who made fervor their greatness, unto them do thou go.
18.2.17 They who fight in the contests (''pradhána''), who are self-sacrificing (''tanūtyáj'') heroes, or who give thousand-fold sacrificial gifts, unto them do thou go.
18.2.18 Poets (''kaví'') of a thousand lays (''-nīthá''), who guard the sun - to the seers rich in fervor, born of fervor, O Yama, do thou go.
18.2.19 Be pleasant to him, O earth, a thornless resting-place; furnish him broad refuge.
18.2.20 In the unoppressive wide space (''loká'') of earth be thou deposited; what ''svadhā́s'' thou didst make when living, be they dripping with honey for thee.
18.2.21 I call thy mind hither with mind; come unto these houses, enjoying [them]; unite thyself with the Fathers, with Yama; let pleasant, helpful (? ''çagmá'') winds blow thee unto [them].
18.2.22 Let the water-carrying, water-floating Maruts carry thee up, making [thee] cool by the goat, let them sprinkle [thee] with rain, splash!
18.2.23 I have called up life-time unto life-time, unto ability (''krátu''), unto dexterity, unto life; let thy mind go to its own pl.; then run unto the Fathers.
18.2.24 Let nothing whatever of thy mind, nor of thy life (''ásu''), nor of thy members, nor of thy sap, nor of thy body, be left here.
18.2.25 Let not the tree oppress thee, nor the great divine earth; having found a place (''loká'') among the Fathers, thrive (''edh'') thou among those whose king is Yama.
18.2.26 What limb of thine is put over at a distance, and what expiration [or] breath has gone forth upon the wind (?), let the associated (''sánīḍa'') Fathers, assembling, make that enter thee again, bit (''ghāsá'') from bit.
18.2.27 The living have excluded this man from their houses; carry ye him out, forth from this village; death was the kindly messenger of Yama; he made his life-breaths (''ásu'') go to the Fathers.
18.2.28 What barbarians (''dásyu''), having entered among the Fathers, having faces of acquaintances, go about, eating what is not sacrificed, who bear ''parāpúr'' [and] ''nipúr'' - Agni shall blast (''dham'') them forth from this sacrifice.
18.2.29 Let there enter together (''sam-viç'') here our own Fathers, doing what is pleasant, lengthening [our] life-time; may we be able to reach them with oblation, living long for numerous autumns.
18.2.30 What milch-cow I set down (''ni-pṛ'') for thee, and what rice-dish for thee in milk (''kṣīrá'') - with that mayest thou be the supporter of the person (''jána'') who is there (''átra'') without a living.
18.2.31 Pass forward [over a stream] rich in horses, which is very propitious, or, further on, an ''ṛkṣā́ka'', more new; he who slew thee, be he one to be killed; let him not find any other portion.
18.2.32 Yama beyond, below Vivasvant - beyond that do I see nothing whatever; into Yama has entered my sacrifice; Vivasvant stretched after the worlds (''bhū́'').
18.2.33 They hid away the immortal one (f.) from mortals; having made one of like color, they gave her to Vivasvant; what that was carried also the two Açvins; and Saraṇyū deserted two twins.
18.2.34 They that are buried, and they that are scattered (''vap'') away, they that are burned and they that are set up (''úddhita'') - all those Fathers, O Agni, bring thou to eat the oblation.
18.2.35 They who, burned with fire, [and] who, not burned with fire, revel on ''svadhā́'' in the midst of heaven - them thou knowest, if thine, O Jātavedas; let them enjoy with ''svadhā́'' the sacrifice, the ''svádhiti''.
18.2.36 Burn (''tap'') thou propitiously (''çám''); do not burn overmuch; O Agni, do not burn the body; be thy vehemence (''çúṣma'') in the woods; on the earth be what is thy violence (''háras'').
18.2.37 I give this release to him who hath thus come and hath become mine here - thus replies the knowing Yama - let this one approach (''upa-sthā'') my wealth here.
18.2.38 This measure do we measure, so that one may not measure further; in a hundred autumns, not before.
18.2.39 This measure do we measure forth, so that etc. etc.
18.2.40 This measure do we measure off, so that etc. etc.
18.2.41 This measure do we measure apart, so that etc. etc.
18.2.42 This measure do we measure out, so that etc. etc.
18.2.43 This measure do we measure up, so that etc. etc.
18.2.44 This measure do we measure together, so that etc. etc.
18.2.45 I have measured the measure, I have gone to heaven (''svàr''); may I be long-lived; so that etc. etc.
18.2.46 Breath, expiration, through-breathing (''vyāná''), life-time, an eye to see the sun: by a road not beset with enemies (''-pára'') go thou to the Fathers whose king is Yama.
18.2.47 They that departed unmarried [but] assiduous, abandoning hatreds, having no progeny - they, going up to heaven (''div''), have found a place (''loká''), they, shining (? ''dī́dhyāna'') upon the back of the firmament.
18.2.48 Watery is the lowest heaven (''dív''), full of stars (? ''pīlu-'') is called the midmost; the third is called the fore-heaven (''pradív''), in which the Fathers sit.
18.2.49 They that are our father's fathers, that are [his] grandfathers, that entered the wide atmosphere, they that dwell upon earth and heaven (''dív'') - to those Fathers would we pay worship with homage.
18.2.50 This time, verily, not further (''áparam''), seest thou the sun in the heaven (''dív''); as a mother her son with her hem (''síc''), do thou cover him, O earth.
18.2.51 This time, verily; not further; in old age another further than this; as a wife her husband with her garment, do thou cover him, O earth (''bhū́mi'').
18.2.52 I cover thee excellently with the garment of mother earth; what is excellent among the living, that with me; ''svadhā́'' among the Fathers, that with thee.
18.2.53 O Agni-and-Soma, makers of roads, ye have distributed (''vi-dhā'') to the gods a pleasant treasure [and] world; send ye unto [us] Pūshan, who shall carry by goat-traveled roads him that goes thither.
18.2.54 Let Pūshan, knowing, urge thee forth from here - he, the shepherd of creation (''bhúvana'') who loses no cattle; may he commit thee to those Fathers, [and] Agni to the beneficent gods.
18.2.55 May life-time, having all life-time, protect thee about; let Pūshan protect thee in front on the forward road; where sit the well-doers, whither they have gone, there let god Savitar set thee.
18.2.56 I yoke for thee these two conveyers ''váhni'', to convey (''vah'') thee to the other life; with them to Yama's seat and to the assemblies go thou down (''áva'').
18.2.57 This garment hath now come first to thee; remove (''apa-ūh'') that one which thou didst wear here before; knowing, do thou follow along with what is offered and bestowed, where it is given thee variously among them of various connection (? ''víbandhu'').
18.2.58 Wrap about thee of kine a protection from the fire; cover thyself up with grease and fatness, lest the bold one, exulting with violence (''háras''), shake thee strongly (''dadṛ́ḥ'') about, intending to consume thee.
18.2.59 Taking the staff from the hand of the deceased man (''gatā́su''), together with hearing, splendor, strength - thou just there, here may we, rich in heroes, conquer all scorners [and] evil plotters.
18.2.60 Taking the bow from the hand of the dead man, together with authority (''kṣatrá''), splendor, strength - take thou hold upon much prosperous good; come thou hitherward unto the world of the living.
;;; 3 Funeral verses.
18.3.1 This woman, choosing her husband's world, lies down (''ni-pad'') by thee that art departed, O mortal, continuing to keep [her] ancient duty (''dhárma''); to her assign thou here progeny and property.
18.3.2 Go up, O woman, to the world of the living; thou liest by (''upa-çī'') this one who is deceased: come! to him who grasps thy hand, thy second spouse (''didhiṣú''), thou hast now entered into the relation of wife to husband.
18.3.3 I saw the maiden being led, being led about, alive, for the dead; as she was enclosed with blind darkness, then I led her off-ward (''ápācī'') from in front (''prāktás'').
18.3.4 Foreknowing, O inviolable one, the world of the living, moving together [with him] upon the road of the gods - this is thy herdsman (''gópati''); enjoy him; make him ascend to the heavenly (''svargá'') world.
18.3.5 Unto sky (''div''), unto reed, more helpful of streams; O Agni, gall of the waters art thou.
18.3.6 Whom thou, O Agni, didst consume, him do thou extinguish again;, let there grow here the ''kyā́mbū'', the ''çāṇḍadūrvā́'', the ''vyàlkaçā''.
18.3.7 Here is one for thee, beyond is one for thee; enter thou into union with the third light; at entrance be thou fair (''cā́ru'') with [thy] body, loved of the gods in the highest station.
18.3.8 Rise thou, go forth, run forth; make thee a home (''ókas'') in the sea [as] station; there do thou, in concord with the Fathers, revel with soma, with the ''svadhā́s''.
18.3.9 Start (''cyu'') forward, collect (''sam-bhṛ'') thy body; let not thy limbs (''gā́tra'') nor thy frame (''çárīra'') be left out; enter together after thy mind that has entered; wherever in the world thou enjoyest, thither go.
18.3.10 Let the soma-drinking (''somyá'') Fathers anoint me with splendor, the gods with honey, with ghee; making me pass further on unto sight, let them increase me, attaining old age, unto old age.
18.3.11 Let Agni anoint me completely with splendor; let Vishṇu anoint wisdom into my mouth; let all the gods fix wealth upon me; let pleasant waters purify me with purifiers.
18.3.12 Mitra-and-Varuṇa have enclosed (''pari-dhā'') me; let the sacrificial posts of Aditi increase me; let Indra anoint splendor into my hands; let Savitar make me one attaining old age.
18.3.13 Him who died first of mortals, who went forth first to that world, Vivasvant's son, assembler of people, king Yama honor ye with oblation.
18.3.14 Go away, ye Fathers, and come; this sacrifice is all anointed with honey for you; both give to us here excellent property, and assign to us wealth having all heroes.
18.3.15 Let Kaṇva, Kakshīvant, Purumīḍha, Agastya, Çyāvāçva, Sobharī, Archanānas, Viçvāmitra, Jamadagni here, Atri, Kaçyapa, Vāmadeva, aid us.
18.3.16 O Viçvāmitra, Jamadagni, Vasishṭha, Bharadvāja, Gotama, Vāmadeva - Atri hath taken (''grabh'') our ''çardís'' with obeisances; ye Fathers of good report, be gracious to us.
18.3.17 They overpass defilement (''riprá''), wiping [it] off in the metal bowl (? ''kasyá''), assuming further on newer life-time, filling themselves up with progeny and riches; then may we be of good odor in the houses.
18.3.18 They anoint, they anoint out (''ví''), they anoint together (''sám''); they lick the rite (? ''krátu''), they smear (''abhi-añj'') with honey; the bull (''ukṣán'') flying in the upheaving of the river, the victim (''paçú'') do the gold-purifiers seize (''gṛh'') in them f..
18.3.19 What of you is joyous, O Fathers, and delectable (''somyá''), therewith be at hand (''sac''), for ye are of own splendor; do ye, rapid (? ''árvan'') poets, listen, beneficent, invoked at the council.
18.3.20 Ye who are Atris, An̄girases, Navagvas, having sacrificed, attached to giving (? ''rātiṣā́c''), bestowers (''dádhāna''), and who are rich in sacrificial fees, well-doing - do ye revel, sitting on this ''barhís''.
18.3.21 So then as our distant Fathers, the ancient ones, O Agni, sharpening the rite: they went to the bright, they shone,* ''should be'' shining, praising with song; splitting the ground, they uncovered the ruddy ones.
18.3.22 Of good actions, well-shining, pious, heavenly ones (''devá''), forging the generations as [smiths forge] metal, brightening Agni, increasing Indra, they have made for us a wide conclave (''pariṣád''), rich in kine.
18.3.23 As herds at food (''kṣúm''), the formidable one hath looked over ''áti'' the cattle, the births of the gods, near by; mortals have lamented the ''urváçīs'', unto the increase of the pious, of the next man.
18.3.24 We have made [sacrifices] for thee; we have been very active; the illuminating (''vi-bhā'') dawns have shone upon [our] rite (''ṛtá''); all that is excellent which the gods favor; may we talk big at the council, having good heroes.
18.3.25 Let Indra with the Maruts protect me from the eastern quarter; arm-moved [is] the earth, as it were to the sky above; to the world-makers, the road-makers, do we sacrifice, whoever of you are here, sharing in the oblation of the gods.

18.3.38 Both from here and from yonder let them (du.) aid me.
18.3.39 Be ye comfortable (? ''svā́sastha'') for our soma. I yoke for you ancient worship (''bráhman'') with obeisances; the song (''çlóka'') goes forth like a patron (''sūrí'') on his road; let all the immortals hear that.
18.3.40 Three steps the form (?) ascended, it went (?) after the four-footed one (f.) with its course (''vratá''); it matches the song (''arká'') with the syllable; in the navel of right it purifies.
18.3.41 For the gods he chose death; for his progeny did he not choose immortality (''amṛ́ta'')? Brihaspati [as] seer extended the sacrifice; Yama left (''ā-ric'') his dear self (?).
18.3.42 Thou, O Agni, Jātavedas, being praised, hast carried the offerings, having made them fragrant; thou hast given to the Fathers; they have eaten after their wont (? ''svadháyā''); eat thou, O god, the presented oblations.
18.3.43 Sitting in the lap of the ruddy ones (f.), assign ye wealth to your mortal worshiper (''dāçvā́ṅs''); of that good, O Fathers, present ye to your sons; do ye bestow (''dhā'') refreshment here.
18.3.44 Ye fire-sweetened Fathers, come hither; sit on each seat, well-conducting ones; eat on the ''barhís'' the presented oblations, and assign to us wealth having all heroes.
18.3.45 Called unto [are] our delectable (''somyá'') Fathers, to dear deposits on the ''barhís;'' let them come; let them listen here; let them bless, let them aid us.
18.3.46 They who, our father's fathers, who [his] grandfathers, followed after (? ''anu-hā'') the soma-drinking, best ones - with them let Yama, sharing his gift of oblations, he eager with them eager, eat at pleasure.
18.3.47 They who thirsted panting among the gods, knowers of offering, praise-fashioned, with songs (''arká'') - come, O Agni, with the thousand god-revering true poets, seers sitting at the ''gharmá''.
18.3.48 The true, oblation-eating, oblation-drinking ones, that [go] in alliance (''sarátham'') with the gods, with strong (''turá'') Indra - come hitherward, O Agni, with the beneficent, exalted (''pára''), ancient seers, sitting at the ''gharmá''.
18.3.49 Approach (''upa-sṛp'') thou this mother earth (''bhū́mi''), the wide-expanded earth (''pṛthivī́''), the very propitious; the earth (''pṛthivī́'') [is] soft as wool to him who has sacrificial gifts; let her protect thee on the forward road in front.
18.3.50 Swell thou up, O earth; do not press down; be to him easy of access, easy of approach; as a mother her son with her skirt (''síc''), do thou, O earth (''bhū́mi''), cover him.
18.3.51 Let the earth kindly remain swelling up, for let a thousand props support (''upa-çri'') it; let these houses, dripping with ghee, pleasant, be forever a refuge for him there (''átra'').
18.3.52 I brace up (''ut-stabh'') the earth from about thee; setting down this clod (? ''logá''), let me take no harm; this pillar do the Fathers maintain for thee; let Yama there make seats for thee.
18.3.53 This bowl, O Agni, do not warp (''vi-hvṛ''); [it is] dear to the gods and the delectable [Fathers]; this bowl here for the gods to drink from - in it let the immortal gods revel.
18.3.54 The bowl that Atharvan bore full to Indra the vigorous, in that he makes a draught of what is well done; in that, soma (''índu'') ever purifies itself.
18.3.55 What of thee the black bird (''çakuná'') thrust at, the ant, the serpent, or also the beast of prey (''çvā́pada''), let the all-eating ''viçva-ád'' Agni make that free from disease, and the soma that hath entered the Brahmans.
18.3.56 Rich in milk are the herbs; rich in milk is my milk; what is the milk of the milk of the waters, therewith let one beautify (''çubh'') me.
18.3.57 Let these women, not widows, well-spoused, touch themselves with ointment, with butter; tearless, without disease, with good treasures, let the wives ascend first to the place of union.
18.3.58 Unite thyself (''sam-gam'') with the Fathers, with Yama, with thy sacred and charitable works in the highest firmament; abandoning what is reproachful, come again home; - let him unite himself with a body, very splendid.
18.3.59 They that are our father's fathers, that are [his] grandfathers, that entered the wide atmosphere - for them may the autocratic (''svarā́j'') second life today shape our bodies as he will.
18.3.60 Let the mist be weal for thee; let the frost fall down [as] weal for thee; O cool one, possessing cool ones; O refreshing one, possessing refreshing ones; mayest thou be with weal a she-frog in the waters; kindly pacify thou this fire.
18.3.61 Let Vivasvant make for us freedom from fear, he who is well-preserving, quick-giving (? ''-dā́nu''), well-giving; let these heroes be many here; let there be in me prosperity (''puṣṭá'') rich in kine, rich in horses.
18.3.62 Let Vivasvant set us in immortality; let death go away; let what is immortal come to us; let [him] defend these men until old age; let not their life-breaths (''ásu'') go to Yama.
18.3.63 He who maintains himself by his might, like [birds?] in the atmosphere, poet of the Fathers, favorer (? ''prámati'') of prayers (''matí'') - him praise ye, all-befriended, with oblations; may that Yama give (''dhā'') us to live further on.
18.3.64 Ascend ye to the highest heaven; O seers, be not afraid; ye soma-drinkers, soma-drenchers, this oblation is made to you; we have gone to the highest light.
18.3.65 Agni shines forth with great show (''ketú''); the bull roars loudly unto the two firmaments (''ródasī''); even from the end of heaven he hath attained unto me (?); in the lap of the waters the buffalo increased.
18.3.66 As, longing with the heart, they looked upon thee, flying up* [as] an eagle in the firmament (''nā́ka''), golden-winged messenger of Varuṇa, busy (''bhuraṇyú'') bird (''çakuná'') in the lair of Yama.
18.3.67 O Indra, bring us ability (''krátu''), as a father to his sons; help (''çikṣ'') us in this course (''yā́man''), O much-invoked one; may we, living, attain to light.
18.3.68 What vessels covered (''api-dhā'') with cakes the gods maintained for thee, be they for thee rich in ''svadhā́'', rich in honey, dripping with ghee.
18.3.69 What grains I scatter along for thee, mixed with sesame, rich in ''svadhā́'', be they for thee abundant (''vibhú''), prevailing; them let king Yama approve for thee.
18.3.70 Give back, O forest tree, him who is deposited here with thee, that in Yama's seat he may sit speaking counsels.
18.3.71 Take hold, O Jātavedas; let thy seizure (''háras'') be with sharpness (''téjas-''); his body do thou consume; then set him in the world of the well-doing.
18.3.72 What Fathers of thine went away earlier and what later, for them let there go a brook of ghee, hundred-streamed, overflowing.
18.3.73 Ascend thou this, gaining (''ud-mṛj'') vigor (''váyas''); thine own [people] shine here greatly; go forth, unto [them], - be not left behind midway - unto the world of the Fathers that is first there.
;;; 4 Funeral verses.
18.4.1 Ascend to [your] generatrix, ye Jātavedases; by [roads] that the Fathers travel I make you ascend together; the offering-carrier, sent out, hath carried the offerings; united (''yuktá''), set ye him who hath sacrificed in the world of the well-doing.
18.4.2 The gods, the seasons, arrange the sacrifice, the oblation, the sacrificial cake, the ladles (''srúc''), the implements (''-ā́yudha'') of sacrifice; with them go thou by roads that the gods travel, by which they that have sacrificed go to the heavenly (''svargá'') world.
18.4.3 Look thou happily (''sādhú'') along the road of righteousness, by which go the An̄girases, well-doers; by those roads go thou to heaven (''svargá''), where the Ādityas feed on honey; spread thou out upon the third firmament.
18.4.4 Three eagles (''suparṇá'')...upon the back of the firmament (''nā́ka''), at the summit (? ''viṣṭáp'') are set (''çritá''); let the heavenly (''svargá'') worlds, filled (?) with ''amṛ́ta'', yield (''duh'') food, refreshment to the sacrificer.
18.4.5 The sacrificial spoon (''juhū́'') sustains the sky, the offering spoon (''upabhṛ́t'') the atmosphere; the ladle (''dhruvā́'') sustains ''dhṛ'' the earth, the support (''pratiṣṭhā́''); unto me (?) let the worlds, ghee-backed, heavenly (''svargá''), yield every desire for the sacrificer.
18.4.6 O ladle, ascend the all-nourishing earth; stride, O offering spoon, unto the atmosphere; O sacrificial spoon, go to the sky (''dív'') in company with the sacrificer; with the little spoon (''sruvá'') [as] calf, milk thou all the teeming, unirritated quarters.
18.4.7 By fords they cross the advances (''pravát'') called the great ones, by what [road] the sacrifice-makers, the well-doers, go; there did they set a world for the sacrificer, when they arranged the quarters, the creatures (''bhūtá'').
18.4.8 The track (''áyana'') of the An̄girases is the eastern fire; the Ādityas' track is the householder's fire; the track of the sacrificial gifts is the southern fire; do thou, with thy limbs, whole (''sárva''), powerful (? ''çagmá''), go unto the greatness of Agni [as] disposed by ''bráhman''.
18.4.9 Let the eastern fire burn (''tap'') thee happily (''çám'') in front; let the householder's fire burn happily behind; let the southern fire burn refuge, defense for thee; from the north, from the midst, from the atmosphere, from each quarter, O Agni, protect him round about from what is terrible.
18.4.10 Ye, O Agni, having become back-carrying (? ''pṛṣṭiváh'') horses, shall with most healthful forms (''tanū́'') carry him that has sacrificed unto the heavenly (''svargá'') world, where they revel in common revelry with the gods.
18.4.11 Burn (''tap''), O Agni, happily behind, happily in front; burn him happily above, happily below; being one, O Jātavedas, triply disposed, set him collectedly (''samyák'') in the world of the well-doers.
18.4.12 Let the fires, kindled, take hold happily; let the Jātavedases, making done (''çṛtá'') here him that is Prajāpati's [and] sacrificial, not throw him down.
18.4.13 The sacrifice goes, extended, adapting itself (? ''kḷp''), [taking] him who hath sacrificed, unto the heavenly (''svargá'') world; let the fires enjoy it, made a whole oblation; let the Jātavedases, making done here him that is Prajāpati's [and] sacrificial, not throw him down.
18.4.14 He that hath sacrificed hath ascended the piled fire, about to fly up to heaven (''dív'') from the back of the firmament (''nā́ka''); for him, the well-doer, shines forth from the welkin (''nábhas''), full of light, the heavenly road, traveled by the gods.
18.4.15 Agni thine invoker, Brihaspati thine officiating priest, be Indra on the right thy supervising priest (''brahmán''); this offered sacrifice, being completed (''sáṁsthita''), goeth where is the ancient track of those offered.
18.4.16 Rich in cakes, rich in milk (''kṣīrá-'') let the dish (''carú'') take seat here; to the world-makers, the road-makers, do we sacrifice, whoever of you are here, sharing in the oblation of the gods.

18.4.26 What grains I scatter along for thee, mixed with sesame, rich in ''svadhā́'', be they for thee uprising (''udbhú''), prevailing; them let king Yama approve for thee.
18.4.27 A more abundant inexhaustibleness.
18.4.28 The drop leaped (''skand'') toward the earth, the sky (''dív''), toward both this lair (''yóni'') and the one that was of old; of the drop that goes about toward the same lair do I make oblation, after seven invocations (''hótrā'').
18.4.29 A hundred-streamed Vāyu, a heaven-finding sun (? ''arká''), wealth, do those men-beholders look upon; whoso bestow (''pṛ'') and present (''prayam'') always, they milk a sacrificial gift having seven mothers.
18.4.30 They milk a receptacle (''kóça''), a jar with four orifices, ''iḍā'' [as] milch-cow rich in honey, in order to well-being; reveling refreshment, Aditi among the people, injure thou not, O Agni, in the highest firmament (''vyòman'').
18.4.31 This garment god Savitar gives thee to wear (''bhṛ''); putting on that, which is ''tārpyà'', do thou go about in Yama's realm.
18.4.32 The grains became a milch-cow; the sesame became her calf; upon her, unexhausted, one lives in Yama's realm.
18.4.33 Be these, O so-and-so, thy milch-kine that yield what is desired; variegated, white, of like form, of different form, with sesame as calf, let them wait upon (''upa-sthā'') thee there.
18.4.34 Grains variegated, yellow, white, grains black, red, [be] thy milch-kine here; with sesame as calf, yielding (''duh'') him refreshment, be they ever unresisting.
18.4.35 In Vāiçvānara I offer this oblation, a thousand-fold, hundred-streamed fountain (''útsa''); it supports (''bhṛ'') [our] father, grandfathers; [our] great-grandfathers it supports, swelling.
18.4.36 A thousand-streamed, hundred-streamed fountain, unexhausted, expanded upon the back of the sea, yielding refreshment, unresisting, do the Fathers wait on at their will (? ''svadhā́bhis'').
18.4.37 This funeral pile (? ''kásāmbu'') [is] piled with piling; come, ye [his] fellows, look down at it; this mortal goeth to immortality; make ye houses for him according to his kindred.
18.4.38 Be thou just here, winning riches, with thought here, with ability here; be thou here, very heroic, vigor-bestowing, not smitten away.
18.4.39 These waters, rich in honey, satisfying (''abhi-tṛp'') son [and] grandson, yielding to the Fathers ''svadhā́'' [and] ''amṛ́ta'' - let the heavenly waters gratify both sides.
18.4.40 O waters, send forth (''pra-hi'') Agni unto the Fathers; this sacrifice of mine let the Fathers enjoy; they who attach themselves unto a sitting refreshment, may they confirm to us wealth having all heroes.
18.4.41 They kindle the immortal one, oblation-carrying, ghee-loving; he knoweth the deposited deposits, the Fathers that are gone away to the distances.
18.4.42 What stirabout for thee, what rice-dish, what flesh I offer (''ni-pṛ'') to thee, be they for thee rich in ''svadhā́'', rich in honey, dripping with ghee.
18.4.43 What grains I scatter along for thee, mixed with sesame, rich in ''svadhā́'', be they for thee abundant, prevailing; them let king Yama approve for thee.
18.4.44 This [is] the former, the after down-track, by which thy former Fathers went away; they who are the forerunners, the followers (? ''abhiṣác'') of it, they carry thee to the world of the well-doing.
18.4.45 On Sarasvatī do the pious call; on Sarasvatī, while the sacrifice is being extended; on Sarasvatī do the well-doers call; may Sarasvatī give what is desirable to the worshiper.
18.4.46 On Sarasvatī do the Fathers call, arriving at the sacrifice on the south; sitting on this ''barhís'', do ye revel; assign thou to us food free from disease.
18.4.47 O Sarasvatī, that wentest in company with the songs, with the ''svadhā́s'', O goddess, reveling with the Fathers, assign thou to the sacrificer here a portion of refreshment of thousand-fold value, abundance of wealth.
18.4.48 Thee, being earth, I make enter into earth; may god Dhātar lengthen out our life-time; let him that goeth very far away be a finder of good for you; then may the dead (pl.) come to be (''sam-bhū'') among the Fathers.
18.4.49 Start ye (du.) forward hither, wipe off that which the portents (? ''abhibhā́'') have said there of you; from that come ye, inviolable ones, to this which is better, being bestowers here on me, a giver to the Fathers.
18.4.50 This sacrificial gift hath come excellently to us, given by him, well-milking, vigor-bestowing; old age, coming close to (? ''upa-pṛc'') them living in youth, shall lead these away together unto the Fathers.
18.4.51 This ''barhís'' I bring forward for the Fathers; a living, higher one I strew for the gods; that do thou ascend, O man, becoming sacrificial; let the Fathers acknowledge thee who art departed.
18.4.52 Thou hast sat upon this ''barhís'', thou hast become sacrificial; let the Fathers acknowledge thee who art departed; collect thy body according to its joints; I arrange thy members with ''bráhman''.
18.4.53 King leaf is the cover of the dishes; the strength of refreshment, the power, vigor, hath come to us, dispensing (''vi-dhā'') life-time to the living (pl.), in order to length of life for a hundred autumns.
18.4.54 The share of refreshment that generated this man; - the stone attained (''gam'') the overlordship of the foods; - him praise ye, all-befriended, with oblations; may that Yama make (''dhā'') us to live further.
18.4.55 As the five clans (''mānavá'') scattered (''vap'') a dwelling (''harmyá'') for Yama, so do I scatter a dwelling, that there may be many of me (?).
18.4.56 Wear (''bhṛ'') thou this gold, which thy father wore before; of thy father, going to heaven (''svargá''), do thou wipe off the right hand.
18.4.57 Both those who are living and those who are dead; those who are born and those who are worshipful - for them let there go a brook of ghee, honey-streamed, overflowing.
18.4.58 There purifies itself the conspicuous bull of the prayers, the sun of days, lengthener out of dawns, of the sky (''dív''); the breath of the rivers hath made the jars to resound loudly; entering Indra's heart with skill.
18.4.59 Let thy sparkling (? ''tveṣá'') smoke cover, being in the sky, extended bright; for thou, O purifier, shinest like the sun with luster, with beauty (''kṛpā́'').
18.4.60 Soma (''índu'') verily goes forward to Indra's rendezvous; the comrade does not violate (''pra-mī'') the comrade's agreements; thou rushest to join, as a male after females - soma, in the jar, by a road of a hundred tracks.
18.4.61 They have eaten; they have revelled surely; they have shaken off (''áva'') those that are dear; having own brightness (''svábhānu''), they have praised; inspired, youngest, we implore.
18.4.62 Come ye, O Fathers, delectable, by profound roads that the Fathers travel, assigning to us lifetime and progeny; and do ye attach yourselves to us with abundances of wealth.
18.4.63 Go away, O Fathers, delectable, by profound roads that go to the stronghold (''pūryā́ṇa''); then, in a month, come ye again to our houses to eat the oblation, with good progeny, with good heroes.
18.4.64 What one limb of you Agni Jātavedas left when making you go to the Fathers' world, that same for you I fill up again; revel ye, O Fathers, in heaven (''svargá'') with [all] your limbs.
18.4.65 Jātavedas has been the messenger sent forth, at evening, at close of day to be honored by men; - thou hast given to the Fathers; they have eaten after their wont; eat thou, O god, the presented oblations.
18.4.66 Thou yonder, ho! hither thy mind! as sisters (''jāmí'') a ''kákutsala'', do thou cover him, O earth.
18.4.67 Let the worlds where the Fathers sit adorn themselves (''çumbh''); I make thee to sit in the world where the Fathers sit.
18.4.68 Thou art the ''barhís'' of them that are our Fathers.
18.4.69 Loosen up the uppermost fetter from us, O Varuṇa, [loosen] down the lowest, off the midmost; then may we in thy sphere, O Āditya, be guiltless unto Aditi.
18.4.70 Release from us all fetters, O Varuṇa, with which one is bound crosswise, with which lengthwise; so may we live hundreds of autumns, by thee, O king, guarded, defended.
18.4.71 To Agni, carrier of the ''kavyás'', [be] ''svadhā́'' [and] homage.
18.4.72 To Soma with the Fathers [be] ''svadhā́'' [and] homage.
18.4.73 To the Fathers with Soma, ''svadhā́'' [and] homage.
18.4.74 To Yama with the Fathers, ''svadhā́'' [and] homage.
18.4.75 Here is ''svadhā́'' for thee, O great-grandfather, and for them that are after (''ánu'') thee.
18.4.76 Here is ''svadhā́'' for thee, O grandfather, and for them that are after thee.
18.4.77 Here is ''svadhā́'' for thee, O father.
18.4.78 ''Svadhā́'' to the Fathers that sit upon the earth.
18.4.79 ''Svadhā́'' to the Fathers that sit in the atmosphere.
18.4.80 ''Svadhā́'' to the Fathers that sit in the sky (''dív'').
18.4.81 Homage, O Fathers, to your refreshment (''ū́rj''); homage, O Fathers, to your sap.
18.4.82 Homage, O Fathers, to your terror* (''bhā́ma''); homage, O Fathers, to your fury.
18.4.83 Homage, O Fathers, to that of yours which is terrible; homage, O Fathers, to that of yours which is cruel.
18.4.84 Homage, O Fathers, to that of yours which is propitious; homage, O Fathers, to that of yours which is pleasant.
18.4.85 Homage to you, O Fathers; ''svadhā́'' to you, O Fathers.
18.4.86 They who are there, O Fathers - Fathers there are ye - [be] they after you; may ye be the best of them.
18.4.87 They who are here, O Fathers - alive here are we - [be] they after us; may we be the best of them.
18.4.88 Thee, O Agni, would we kindle, full of light (''dyumánt''), O god, unwasting; as that very wondrous fuel of thine shall shine in the sky (''dív''), bring thou food for thy praisers.
18.4.89 The moon among the waters runs, an eagle in the sky (''dív''); they find not your track, O golden-rimmed lightnings: know me as such, O firmaments (''ródasī'').
19.4.1 Together, together let the rivers flow, together the winds, together the birds; increase ye this sacrifice, O songs (''gír''); I make offering with an oblation of confluence.
19.4.2 This sacrifice do ye aid, O offerings (''hóma''); this one, ye also that flow together: increase ye this sacrifice, O songs; I make offering with an oblation of confluence.
19.4.3 Form by form, vigor (''váyas'') by vigor - taking hold together I embrace him: let the four quarters increase this sacrifice; I make offering with an oblation of confluence.
;;; 2 Praise and prayer to the waters.
19.2.1 Weal to thee [be] the waters from the snowy mountains (''hāimavatá''), and weal be to thee those from the fountains; weal to thee the running waters, and weal to thee be those of the rain.
19.2.2 Weal to thee [be] the waters of the wastes, weal be to thee those of the marshes; weal to thee the waters of the canals (''khanitríma''), weal those brought with vessels.
19.2.3 Digging for themselves without shovels, keen (''vípra''), working in the deep (''gambhīrá''), more healing than the healers (''bhiṣáj''), the waters we address.
19.2.4 Of the waters indeed from the sky, of the waters from the streams (''srotasyà'') - in the forth-washing indeed of the waters, ye become vigorous (''vājín'') horses.
19.2.5 Weal [be] to thee the waters, propitious the waters, effecting freedom from ''yákṣma'' the waters; just as joy to one who thirsts, [be] they for thee healers of dislocation.
;;; 3 Praise to Agni.

19.3.3 What thy heavenly (''svargá'') greatness is, among the gods, what body of thine entered into the Fathers, what prosperity of thine was spread among men (''manuṣyà'') - therewith, O Agni, assign wealth to us.
19.3.4 To him of hearing ears, the poet, worthy to be known, I apply for gifts (''rātí'') with words, with speeches; whence [there is] fear, be there no fear for us; pacify (''ava-yaj''), O Agni, the wrath (''héḍas'') of the gods.
;;; 4 To various divinities.
19.4.1 What oblation (''ā́huti'') Atharvan sacrificed first, with what one Jātavedas made an offering, that same do I first call loudly for thee; gratified with that, let Agni carry the offering: hail to Agni.
19.4.2 Heavenly fortunate design (''ā́kūti'') do I put forward (''puro-dhā''); let the mother of intent (''cittá'') be easy of invocation for us; to what expectation I go, be it entirely mine; may I find it entered into [my] mind.

;;; 6 Purusha and his sacrifice.
19.6.1 Thousand-armed is Purusha, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed; he, covering the earth entirely, exceeded it by ten fingers' breadth.
19.6.2 With three feet he ascended the sky; a foot of him, again, was here; so he strode out asunder, after eating and non-eating.
19.6.3 So many are his greatnesses; and Purusha is superior (''jyā́jān'') to that; a foot of him is all beings (''bhūtá''); three feet of him are what is immortal in the sky.
19.6.4 Purusha is just this all, what is and what is to be; also [is he] lord (''īçvará'') of immortality, which was together with another.
19.6.5 When they separated (''vi-dhā'') Purusha, in how many parts did they distribute (''vi-kḷp'') him? what was his face? what his (two) arms? what are called his (two) thighs [and] feet?

19.6.10 When, with Purusha as oblation, the gods extended the sacrifice, spring was its sacrificial butter, summer its fuel, autumn its oblation.
19.6.11 They sprinkled with the early rain (''prāvṛ́ṣ'') that sacrifice, Purusha, born in the beginning; therewith the gods sacrificed, the Perfectibles (''sādhyá'') and they that are Vasus.
19.6.12 From that were born horses, and whatever [animals] have teeth in both jaws; kine were born from that; from that [are] born goats and sheep.
19.6.13 From that all-sacrificing sacrifice were born the verses (''ṛ́c''), the chants (''sā́man''); meter sic! were born from that; sacrificial formula was born from that.
19.6.14 From that all-sacrificing sacrifice was collected the speckled butter (''pṛṣadājyá''); it made those cattle belonging to Vāyu - those that are of the forest and of the village.
19.6.15 Seven were made its enclosing sticks (''paridhí''), thrice seven its pieces of fuel, when the gods, extending the sacrifice, bound Purusha as victim.

19.8.3 Be it for me well at sunset (?), well in early morning, well at evening, well by day; be it for me well with beasts, well with birds; with easy invocation, O Agni, having gone with well-being to a mortal, come thou again enjoying.
19.8.4 Detraction, evil gossip, reproach, sneezing about (?) - them, O Savitar, drive (''suva'') away for me empty-handed (?), with all.
19.8.5 [Drive] away evil sneezing about; may we enjoy (''bhaj'') propitious (''púṇya'') sneezing; let the evil-nosed jackal and ''púṇyaga'' urinate upon [it] for thee.
19.8.6 These (fem.), O Brahmaṇaspati, that go dispersing upon the wind - do thou, O Indra, making them come together, make them most propitious for me.

19.50.4 As the millet-seed, flying forth, blowing away, is not found, so, O night, make him fly forth who is malicious against us.
19.50.5 Thou didst make the thief stay away, and the kine-driving robber, also him who, haltering the courser's head, tries to lead it [away].

19.53.2 Seven wheels doth this time drive; seven [are] his naves, immortality (''amṛ́ta'') forsooth [his] axle; he, time, including (?) all these beings, goes on as first god.
19.53.3 A full vessel is set upon time; we indeed see it, being now manifoldly; it [is] in front of all these beings; it call they time in the highest firmament (''vyòman'').
19.53.4 He indeed together brought beings; he indeed together went about (''pari-i'') beings; being father, he became son of them; than him verily there is no other brilliancy that is higher (''pára'').
19.53.5 Time generated yonder sky, time also these earths; what is and what is to be stands out sent forth by time.
19.53.6 Time created the earth; in time burns (''tap'') the sun; in time [are] all existences; in time the eye looks abroad.

19.54.3 Time, [their] son, generated of old what is and what is to be. Comm's 3 '''a, b'''. From time the verses (''ṛ́c'') came into being; the sacrificial formula ('''yájus''') was born from time; -
19.54.4 Time set in motion (''sam-īr'') the sacrifice, an unexhausted portion for the gods. Comm's 4 '''a, b'''. In time are set firm the Gandharvas-and-Apsarases; in time the worlds; -
19.54.5 Upon time stand this heavenly An̄giras and Atharvan. Comm's 5 '''a, b'''. Both this world and the highest world, and the pure (''púṇya'') worlds and the pure separations

;;; 56 To sleep (or dream).
19.56.1 Out of Yama's world hast thou come hither (''ā-bhū''); with mirth (?) dost thou, wise, make use of (''pra-yuj'') mortals; knowing, thou goest in alliance (''sarátham'') with the solitary one, fashioning (''mā'') sleep in the lair (''yóni'') of the Asura.
19.56.2 The all-vigorous bond saw thee in the beginning, in the one day before the birth of night; from thence, O sleep, didst thou come (''ā-bhū'') hither, hiding thy form from the physicians.
19.56.3 He of great kine (?) turned unto the gods away from the Asuras, seeking greatness; to that sleep the three-and-thirty ones, having attained the sky, imparted over-lordship.
19.56.4 Not the Fathers, and not the gods, know it, whose (pl.) murmur goes about within here; in Trita Āptya did the men (''nṛ́''), the Ādityas, taught by Varuṇa, set sleep.
19.56.5 Of whom the evil-doers shared ''bhaj'' the cruelty, the well-doers, by non-sleep, [shared] the pure (''púṇya'') life-time - thou revelest in the sky (''svàr'') with the highest relative; thou wast born out of the mind of one practising fervor.

19.57.3 Embryo of the wives of the gods, instrument of Yama, excellent dream; the evil [dream] that is mine, that do we send forth to him that hates us.
19.57.4 Thee that art "harsh" by name, mouth of the black bird (''-çakúni'') - thee, O sleep, we thus know completely; do thou, O sleep, as a horse a halter, as a horse a girth, scatter him who is not of us, the god-reviler, the mocker.
19.57.5 What evil-dreaming is in us, what in our kine, and what in our house, that let him who is not of us, the god-reviler, the mocker, put on like a necklace (''niṣká'').
19.57.6 Having measured off nine cubits, forth from that do we divide off to him who hates us all our evil-dreaming.

19.58.3 Heaven-and-earth have become joint-seizers of splendor; seizing splendor may we go about upon the earth; with glory the kine, coming, wait upon (''upa-sthā'') the lord of kine; seizing glory may we go about upon the earth.
19.58.4 Make ye a pen (''vrajá''), for that is men-protecting for you; sew ye coats-of-mail (''várman''), abundant, broad; make ye strongholds of metal, unattackable (''ádhṛṣṭā''); let not your bowl leak (''sru''); make it strong.
19.58.5 Of the sacrifice the eye, beginning, and face; with voice, with hearing, with mind do I make oblation; to this sacrifice, extended by the all-working one, let the gods come ''ā-i'', with favoring minds.
19.58.6 They that are priests (''ṛtvíj'') of the gods, and that are worshipful, for whom the oblation (''havyá'') is made the portion - coming to this sacrifice together with their spouses, let the gods, as many as they are (''yā́vant''), revel on the oblation.
;;; 59 For successful sacrifice.

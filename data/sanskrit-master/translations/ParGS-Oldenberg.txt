1.1.1 [*1] Now henceforth the performance of the domestic sacrifices of cooked food (will be explained).
1.1.2 [*2]. Having wiped (around the surface on which he intends to perform a sacrifice), having besmeared it (with cowdung), having drawn the lines thereon, having taken the earth out (of the lines), having besprinkled (the place with water), having established the (sacred) fire, having spread out the seat for the Brahman to the south, having carried forward (the Pranita water), having spread (Kusa grass) round (the fire), having put down (the different things used at the sacrifice) according as they are wanted, having prepared two (Kusa blades used as) strainers, having consecrated the Prokshani water, having sprinkled (with that water the sacrificial implements) according to what is needed, having poured out (the Agya or sacrificial butter into the pot), and having put the sacrificial butter on the fire, he should (lustrate the butter by) moving a fire-brand round it.
1.1.3 Having warmed the (sacrificial spoon called) Sruva, having wiped it, having besprinkled it (with water), and warmed it again, he should put it down.
1.1.4 [*4]. Having taken the Agya from the fire, having purified it, having looked at it, and (having purified) the Prokshani water as above, having taken up the Kusa blades with which he is to take hold (of the Agya pot) by its under surface, having put pieces of wood on (the fire), and having sprinkled (water round it), he should sacrifice.
1.1.5 This is the rite wherever a sacrifice is performed.

1.2.1 [*1]. The setting up of the Avasathya (or sacred domestic) fire (is performed) at the time of his wedding.
1.2.2 [*2]. At the time of the division of the inheritance, according to some (teachers).
1.2.3 [*3] After he has fetched fire from the house of a Vaisya who is rich in cattle,--
1.2.4 [*4]. All ceremonies are performed as at the cooking of the katushprasya food.
1.2.5 [*5]. Some (say that) the handing over of the kindling sticks (should take place),
1.2.6 [*6]. Because the Sruti says, 'There are five great sacrifices.'
1.2.7 [*7]. Having cooked a mess of sacrificial food for the deities of the Agnyadheya, and having sacrificed the two Agya portions, he sacrifices (the following) Agya oblations:
1.2.8 [*8]. 'Thou, Agni' (Vag. Samhita XXI, 3); 'Thus thou, Agni' (Vag. Samhita XXI, 4); 'This, O Varuna' (XXI, 1); 'For this I entreat thee' (XXI, 2); 'Thy hundred' (Katy.-Sraut. XXV, 1, 11); 'And quick, Agni' (Katy. l.l.); 'The highest one' (Vag. Samh. XII, 12); 'Be both to us' (ibid. V, 3)--with (these verses he sacrifices) eight (oblations) before (the oblations of cooked food).
1.2.9 Thus he sacrifices also afterwards, after he has made oblations of the mess of cooked food to the deities of the Agnyadheya.
1.2.10 And to (Agni) Svishtakrit,
1.2.11 [*11]. With (the formulas), 'Into the quick one (has been put) Agni's (sacrificial portion) over which the word vashat has been spoken;' 'What I have done too much;' 'O gods who know the way.'
1.2.12 [*12]. Having sacrificed the Barhis, he partakes (of the sacrificial food).
1.2.13 Then food is given to the Brahmanas.


1.3.1 [*1]. To six persons the Arghya reception is due: to a teacher, to an officiating priest, to the father-in-law, to the king, to a friend, to a Snataka.
1.3.2 [*2-3]. They should honour them (with the Arghya reception) once a year.
1.3.3 But officiating priests (they should receive) whenever they intend to perform a sacrifice.
1.3.4 Having ordered a seat to be got (for the guest), he says, 'Well, sir! sit down! We will do honour to you, sir!'
1.3.5 They get for him a couch (of grass) to sit down on, another for the feet, water for washing the feet, the Argha water, water for sipping, and the honey-mixture, i.e. curds, honey, and ghee, in a brass vessel with a brass cover.
1.3.6 [*6]. Another person three times announces (to the guest) the couch and the other things (when they are offered to him).
1.3.7 He accepts the couch.
1.3.8 [*8]. He sits down thereon with (the verse), 'I am the highest one among my people, as the sun among the thunder-bolts. Here I tread on whosoever infests me.'
1.3.9 [*9-10]. With the feet (he treads) on the other (bundle of grass).
1.3.10 When he is seated on the couch, he washes (for his guest) the left foot and then the right foot.
1.3.11 [*11]. If (the host) is a Brahmana, the right first.
1.3.12 [*12]. (He does so) with (the formula), 'The milk of Virag art thou. The milk of Virag may I obtain. (May) the milk of Padya Virag (dwell) in me.'
1.3.13 [*13]. He accepts the Arghya water with (the words), 'Waters are ye. May I obtain through you all my wishes.'
1.3.14 Pouring it out he recites over (the waters the formula), 'To the ocean I send you; go back to your source. Unhurt be our men. May my sap not be shed.'
1.3.15 He sips water with (the formula), 'Thou camest to me with glory. Unite me with lustre. Make me beloved by all creatures, the lord of cattle, unhurtful for the bodies.'
1.3.16 [*16]. With (the formula), 'With Mitra's' (Vag. Samh., Kanvasakha II, 3, 4) he looks at the Madhuparka.
1.3.17 [*17]. With (the formula), 'By the impulse of the god Savitri' (Vag. Samh. l.l.) he accepts it.
1.3.18 [*18]. Taking it into his left hand he stirs it about three times with the fourth finger of his right hand with (the formula), 'Adoration to the brown-faced One. What has been damaged in thee, when the food was eaten, that I cut off from thee.'
1.3.19 And with the fourth finger and the thumb he spirts away (some part of the Madhuparka) three times.
1.3.20 He partakes of it three times with (the formula), 'What is the honied, highest form of honey, and the enjoyment of food, by that honied, highest form of honey, and by that enjoyment of food may I become highest, honied, and an enjoyer of food.'
1.3.21 [*21]. Or with (the verses) that contain the word 'honey,' verse by verse.
1.3.22 [*22]. Let him give the remainder (of the Madhuparka) to a son or a pupil who is sitting to the north.
1.3.23 [*23]. Or let him eat the whole of it (himself).
1.3.24 [*24]. Or he should pour out (the remainder) to the east, at an unfrequented spot.
1.3.25 Having sipped water, he touches his bodily organs with (the formula), 'May speech dwell in my mouth, breath in my nose, sight in my eyes, hearing in my ears, strength in my arms, vigour in my thighs. May my limbs be unhurt, may my body be united with my body!'
1.3.26 When (the guest) has sipped water, (the host), holding a butcher's knife, says to him three times, 'A cow!'
1.3.27 He replies, 'The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the sister of the Adityas, the navel of immortality. To the people who understand me, I say, "Do not kill the guiltless cow, which is Aditi." I kill my sin and N.N.'s sin,'--thus, if he chooses to have it killed.
1.3.28 But if he chooses to let it loose, he should say, 'My sin and N.N.'s sin has been killed. Om! Let it loose! Let it eat grass!'
1.3.29 [*29-30]. But let the Argha not be without flesh.
1.3.30 On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say, 'Make it (ready).'
1.3.31 [*31]. Even if he performs more than one Soma sacrifice during one year, let only priests who have received (from him) the Arghya reception, officiate for him, not such who have not received it; for this has been prescribed in the Sruti.

1.4.1 [*1-5]. There are four kinds of Pakayagnas, viz. the huta, the ahuta, the prahuta, and the prasita.
1.4.2 On the following five occasions, viz. the wedding, the tonsure (of the child's head), the initiation (of the Brahmakarin), the cutting of the beard, and the parting of the hair, (on these occasions) in the outer hall,
1.4.3 On a place that has been smeared (with cow-dung), which is elevated, and which has been sprinkled (with water), he establishes the fire,
1.4.4 Having kindled it by attrition, according to some teachers, at his marriage.
1.4.5 During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day he shall seize the hand of a girl,
1.4.6 [*6]. Under one of the (three times) three Nakshatras of which a constellation designated as Uttara is first,
1.4.7 Or under (the Nakshatras) Svati, Mrigasiras, or Rohini.
1.4.8 Three (wives are allowed) to a Brahmana, in accordance with the order of the castes,
1.4.9 Two to a Raganya,
1.4.10 One to a Vaisya,
1.4.11 One Sudra wife besides to all, according to some (teachers), without using Mantras (at the ceremonies of wedding, &c.).
1.4.12 [*12]. He then makes her put on the (under) garment with (the verse), 'Live to old age; put on the garment! Be a protectress of the human tribes against imprecation. Live a hundred years full of vigour; clothe thyself in wealth and children. Blessed with life put on this garment!'
1.4.13 [*13]. Then the upper garment with (the verse), 'The goddesses who spun, who wove, who spread out, and who drew out the threads on both sides, may those goddesses clothe thee for the sake of long life. Blessed with life put on this garment!'
1.4.14 [*14]. (The bride's father?) anoints the two, (while the bridegroom recites the verse,) 'May the Visve devas, may the waters unite our hearts. May Matarisvan, may Dhatri, may Deshtri (the 'showing' goddess) join us.'
1.4.15 (The bridegroom), having accepted her who is given away by her father, takes her and goes away (from that place) with (the verse), 'When thou wanderest far away with thy heart to the regions of the world like the wind, may the gold-winged Vaikarna (i.e. the wind?) grant that thy heart may dwell with me! N.N.!'
1.4.16 [*16]. He then makes them look at each other (while the bridegroom repeats the verses), 'With no evil eye, not bringing death to thy husband, bring luck to the cattle, be full of joy and vigour. Give birth to heroes; be godly and friendly. Bring us luck, to men and animals. 'Soma has acquired (thee) first (as his wife); after him the Gandharva has acquired (thee). Thy third husband is Agni; the fourth is thy human husband. 'Soma has given thee to the Gandharva; the Gandharva has given thee to Agni. Wealth and children Agni has given to me, and besides this wife. 'Pushan! Lead her to us, the highly blessed one. Sa na uru usati vihara, yasyam usantah praharama sepam yasyam u kama bahavo nivishtya (nivishta?) iti.'

1.5.1 Having led her around the fire, keeping it on his right side, according to some (teachers)--
1.5.2 Having pushed with his right foot a bundle of grass or a mat to the west of the fire, he sits down.
1.5.3 [*3]. While (the bride) touches him, (the following oblations are made:) the two Aghara oblations, the two Agya portions, the Mahavyahritis, the general expiation, the Pragapatya oblation, and the Svishtakrit.
1.5.4 These are regular (oblations) at every sacrifice.
1.5.5 The Svishtakrit comes before the Mahavyahritis, if the sacrificial food is different from Agya.
1.5.6 [*6]. The place for the insertion (of the peculiar oblations belonging to the different sacrifices) is the interval between the general expiation and the oblation to Pragapati.
1.5.7 At the wedding (he may make oblations) with the Rashtrabhrit formulas (i.e. the formulas procuring royal power), if he likes, and with the Gaya and Abhyatana formulas (i.e. the formulas procuring victory, and aiming [at the hostile powers]), if he knows them--
1.5.8 [*8]. Because it has been said, 'By what sacrifice he wishes to attain success.'
1.5.9 [*9]. (The Gaya formulas run thus): 'Thought and thinking. Intention and intending. The understood and understanding. The mind and the Sakvari (verses). The new moon and the full moon. Brihat and Rathantara. 'Pragapati, the powerful one in victorious battles, has given victories (or, the Gaya formulas) to manly Indra. To him all subjects bowed down; he has become powerful and worthy of sacrifice. Svaha!
1.5.10 [*10]. (The Abhyatana formulas run thus): 'May Agni, the lord of beings, protect me. May Indra, (the lord) of the noblest, Yama, of the earth, Vayu, of the air, the Sun, of heaven, the Moon, of the Nakshatras, Brihaspati, of the Brahman, Mitra, of truth, Varuna, of the waters, the sea, of the rivers, food, the lord of royalty, protect me. May Soma, (the lord) of herbs, Savitri, of impulses, Rudra, of cattle, Tvashtri, of forms, Vishnu, of mountains, the Maruts, the lords of hosts, protect me. May the fathers, the grandfathers, the former, the later, the fathers, the grandfathers protect me here in this power of holiness, in this worldly power, in this prayer, in this Purohitaship, in this sacrifice, in this invocation of the gods. Svaha!'--this is added each time.
1.5.11 (He then makes other oblations with the following texts:) 'May Agni come hither, the first of gods. May he release the offspring of this wife from the fetter of death. That may this king Varuna grant, that this wife may not weep over distress (falling to her lot) through her sons. Svaha! 'May Agni Garhapatya protect this woman. May he lead her offspring to old age. With fertile womb may she be the mother of living children. May she experience delight in her sons. Svaha! 'Make, Agni, all ways of heaven and earth blissful to us, O thou who art worthy of sacrifices. What is great, born on this (earth); and praised, (born) in heaven, that bestow on us, rich treasures. Svaha! 'Come hither, showing us an easy path. Give us bright, undecaying life. May death go away; may immortality come to us. May Vivasvat's son make us safe from danger. Svaha!
1.5.12 And the (verse), 'Another way, O death' (Vag. Samh. XXXV, 7), after the eating (of the remnant of the sacrificial food), according to some (teachers).

1.6.1 [*1]. The girl's brother pours out of his joined hands into her joined hands fried grain mixed with Sami leaves.
1.6.2 [*2]. This she sacrifices, with firmly joined hands, standing, (while the bridegroom recites the verses,) 'To the god Aryaman the girls have made sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god Aryaman, loosen us from here, and not from the husband. Svaha! 'This woman, strewing grains, prays thus, "May my husband live long; may my relations be prosperous." Svaha! 'These grains I throw into the fire: may this bring prosperity to thee, and may it unite me with thee. May Agni grant us that. N.N.! Svaha!'
1.6.3 [*3]. He then seizes her right hand together with the thumb, with (the verses), 'I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness, that thou mayst live to old age with me, thy husband. Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitri, Purandhi, the gods have given thee to me that we may rule our house. 'This am I, that art thou; that art thou, this am I. The Saman am I, the Rik thou; the heaven I, the earth thou. 'Come! Let us marry. Let us unite our sperm. Let us beget offspring. Let us acquire many sons, and may they reach old age. 'Loving, bright, with genial minds may we see a hundred autumns, may we live a hundred autumns, may we hear a hundred autumns!'

1.7.1 [*1]. He then makes her tread on a stone, to the north of the fire, with her right foot, (repeating the verse,) 'Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm. Tread the foes down; turn away the enemies.'
1.7.2 He then sings a song: 'Sarasvati! Promote this (our undertaking), O gracious one, bountiful one, thou whom we sing first of all that is, in whom what is, has been born, in whom this whole world dwells--that song I will sing to-day which will be the highest glory of women.'
1.7.3 They then go round (the fire) with (the verse, which the bridegroom repeats,) 'To thee they have in the beginning carried round Surya (the Sun-bride) with the bridal procession. Mayst thou give back, Agni, to the husbands the wife together with offspring.'
1.7.4 [*4]. Thus (the same rites are repeated) twice again, beginning from the fried grain.
1.7.5 [*5]. The fourth time she pours the whole fried grain by the neb of a basket (into the fire) with (the words), 'To Bhaga svaha!'
1.7.6 After he has led her round (the fire) three times, and has sacrificed the oblation to Pragapati--


1.8.1 [*1]. Then he makes her step forward in a northern direction seven steps (with the words), 'One for sap, two for juice, three for the prospering of wealth, four for comfort, five for cattle, six for the seasons. Friend! be with seven steps (united to me). So be thou devoted to me.'
1.8.2 (The words), 'May Vishnu lead thee' are added to every part (of the formula).
1.8.3 [*3]. From the moment of their going away a man who holds a water-pot on his shoulder, stands silent to the south of the fire;
1.8.4 To the north, (according to the opinion) of some (teachers).
1.8.5 From that (pot) he sprinkles her (with water) on her head (with the formula), 'The blessed, the most blessed waters, the peaceful ones, the most peaceful ones, may they give medicine to thee'--
1.8.6 And with the three (verses), Ye waters are' (Vag. Samh. XI, 50-52).
1.8.7 He then makes her look at the sun with (the verse), 'That eye' (Vag. Samh. XXXVI, 24.).
1.8.8 [*8]. He then touches her heart, (reaching) over her right shoulder, with (the words), 'Into my will I take thy heart; thy mind shall follow my mind; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all thy heart; may Pragapati join thee to me.'
1.8.9 [*9]. He then recites over her (the verse), 'Auspicious ornaments does this woman wear. Come up to her and behold her. Having brought luck to her, go away back to your houses.'
1.8.10 [*10]. A strong man snatches her up from the ground, and sets her down in an eastern or northern direction in an out-of-the-way house, on a red bull's hide, with (the words), 'Here may the cows sit down, here the horses, here the men. Here may sacrifice with a thousand gifts, here may Pushan sit down.'
1.8.11 And what (the people in) the village tell them, that they should do.
1.8.12 [*12]. For it is said, 'At weddings and funerals he shall enter the village;'
1.8.13 (And) because the Sruti says, 'Therefore on these two occasions authority rests with the village.'
1.8.14 To the teacher (who helps at the wedding ceremonies) he gives an optional gift.
1.8.15 [*15-17]. A cow is the optional gift to be given by a Brahmana,
1.8.16 A village by a Raganya,
1.8.17 A horse by a Vaisya.
1.8.18 [*18]. A hundred (cows) with a chariot (he gives to a father) who has only daughters.
1.8.19 [*19]. After sunset he shows her the firm star (i.e. the polar-star) with (the words), 'Firm art thou; I see thee, the firm one. Firm be thou with me, O thriving one! 'To me Brihaspati has given thee; obtaining offspring through me, thy husband, live with me a hundred autumns.'
1.8.20 If she does not see (the polar-star), let her say notwithstanding, 'I see,' &c.
1.8.21 [*21]. Through a period of three nights they shall eat no saline food; they shall sleep on the ground; through one year they shall refrain from conjugal intercourse, or through a period of twelve nights, or of six nights, or at least of three nights.

1.9.1 [*1]. Beginning from the wedding the worshipping of the Aupasana (i.e. sacred domestic) fire (is prescribed).
1.9.2 [*2]. After sunset and before sunrise (the fire should be worshipped) with (oblations of) curds, (rice) grains, or fried grains.
1.9.3 (He sacrifices) in the evening with (the formulas), 'To Agni svaha! To Pragapati svaha!'
1.9.4 In the morning with (the formulas), 'To Surya svaha! To Pragapati svaha!'
1.9.5 [*5]. 'Men are both Mitra and Varuna; men are both the Asvins; men are Indra and Surya. May a man be born in me! Again svaha!'--with (this verse) a wife who desires to conceive, (should offer) the first (oblation).

1.10.1 [*1]. If (in the chariot) of a king the axle breaks, or something that is bound loosens itself, or the chariot is overturned, or if another accident happens, or (if one of these same things occurs) when a bride is carried home, he establishes the same fire, prepares Agya, and sacrifices (two Agya oblations) separately with the two Mantras, 'Here is joy' (Vag. Samh. VIII, 51 a).
1.10.2 Having got ready another chariot, he (i.e. the Purohita or the bridegroom) should make the king or the woman sit down thereon with (the formula), 'In royal power' down to the word, 'in sacrifice'
[paragraph continues] (Vag. Samh. XX, 10), and with the (verse), 'I have seized thee' (ibid. XII, 11).
1.10.3 The two beasts that draw the chariot, constitute the sacrificial fee.
1.10.4 (This is) the penance.
1.10.5 Then (follows) feeding of the Brahmanas.

1.11.1 In the fourth night (after the wedding), towards morning, (the husband) establishes the fire within (the house), assigns his seat, to the south (of it), to the Brahman, places a pot of water to the north, cooks a mess of sacrificial food, sacrifices the two Agya portions, and makes (other) Agya oblations with (the following Mantras):
1.11.2 [*2]. 'Agni! Expiation! Thou art the expiation of the gods. I, the Brahmana, entreat thee, desirous of protection. The substance which dwells in her that brings death to her husband, that extirpate in her. Svaha! 'Vayu! Expiation! Thou art the expiation of the gods. I, the Brahmana, entreat thee, desirous of protection. The substance which dwells in her that brings death to her children, that extirpate in her. Svaha! 'Surya! Expiation! Thou art the expiation of the gods. I, the Brahmana, entreat thee, desirous of protection. The substance which dwells in her that brings death to cattle, that extirpate in her. Svaha! 'Kandra! Expiation! Thou art the expiation of the gods. I, the Brahmana, entreat thee, desirous of protection. The substance which dwells in her that brings destruction to the house, that extirpate in her. Svaha! 'Gandharva! Expiation! Thou art the expiation of the gods. I, the Brahmana, entreat thee, desirous of protection. The substance which dwells in her that brings destruction to fame, that extirpate in her. Svaha!'
1.11.3 He sacrifices of the mess of cooked food with (the words), 'To Pragapati svaha!'
1.11.4 [*4]. Each time after he has sacrificed, he pours the remainder of the oblations into the water-pot, and out of that (pot) he besprinkles her on her head with (the words), 'The evil substance which dwells in thee that brings death to thy husband, death to thy children, death to cattle, destruction to the house, destruction to fame, that I change into one that brings death to thy paramour. Thus live with me to old age, N.N.!'
1.11.5 He then makes her eat the mess of cooked food with (the words), 'I add breath to thy breath, bones to thy bones, flesh to thy flesh, skin to thy skin.'
1.11.6 [*6]. Therefore one should not wish for sport with the wife of a Srotriya who knows this; for the other one is a person who knows this (and is thereby enabled to destroy a lover of his wife).
1.11.7 After he has led her to his house, be should cohabit with her after each of her monthly periods,
1.11.8 [*8]. Or as he likes, because it has been said, 'May we have intercourse as we like, until a child is born.'
1.11.9 [*9]. He then touches her heart, (reaching) over her right shoulder, with (the verse), 'O thou whose hair is well parted! Thy heart that dwells in heaven, in the moon, that I know; may it know me. May we see a hundred autumns; may we live a hundred autumns; may we hear a hundred autumns.'
1.11.10 In the same way afterwards.

1.12.1 [*1]. At the beginning of each half-month he cooks a mess of sacrificial food, sacrifices to the deities of the festivals of the new and full moon (as stated in the Srauta ritual), and then sacrifices to the following deities: to Brahman, to Pragapati, to the Visve devas, and to Heaven and Earth.
1.12.2 [*2]. To the Visve devas a Bali is offered, to the domestic deities, and to Akasa (i.e. the Ether).
1.12.3 [*3]. From the Vaisvadeva food he makes oblations in the fire with (the formulas), 'To Agni svaha! To Pragapati svaha! To the Visve devas svaha! To Agni Svishtakrit svaha!'
1.12.4 Outside (the house) the wife offers the Bali with (the formulas), 'Adoration to the wife! Adoration to the man! To every time of life, adoration! To the white one with the black teeth, the lord of the bad women, adoration! 'They who allure my offspring, dwelling in the village or in the forest, to them be adoration; I offer a Bali to them. Be welfare to me! May they give me offspring.'
1.12.5 The remainder he washes out with water. Then (follows) feeding of the Brahmanas.

1.13.1 [*1]. If she does not conceive, he should, after having fasted, under (the Nakshatra) Pushya, lay down (in his house) the root of a white-blooming Simhi plant, and on the fourth day, after (his wife) has bathed, he should in the night-time crush it in water and insert it into her right nostril with (the verse), 'This herb is protecting, overcoming, and powerful. May I, the son of this great (mother), obtain the name of a father!'

1.14.1 Now the Pumsavana (i.e. the ceremony to secure the birth of a male child),
1.14.2 Before (the child in his mother's womb) moves, in the second or third month (of pregnancy).
1.14.3 [*3]. On a day on which the moon stands in conjunction with a Nakshatra (that has a name) of masculine gender, on that day, after having caused (his wife) to fast, to bathe, and to put on two garments which have not yet been washed, and after having in the night-time crushed in water descending roots and shoots of a Nyagrodha tree, he inserts (that into her right nostril) as above, with the two (verses),
[paragraph continues] 'The gold-child' (Vag. Samh. XIII, 4) and 'Formed of water' (ibid. XXXI, 17);
1.14.4 [*14_4]. A Kusa needle and a Soma stalk, according to some (teachers).
1.14.5 [*5]. And he puts gall of a tortoise on her lap. If he desires; 'May (the son) become valiant,' he recites over him (i.e. over the embryo), modifying the rite (?), 'The Suparna art thou' (Vag. Samh. XII, 4), (the Yagus) before (the formulas called) 'steps of Vishnu.'


1.15.1 Now the Simantonnayana (or parting of the pregnant wife's hair).
1.15.2 [*2]. (it is performed) like the Pumsavana;
1.15.3 In her first pregnancy, in the sixth or eighth month.
1.15.4 [*15_4]. After he has cooked a mess of sacrificial food, containing sesamum and Mudga beans, and has sacrificed to Pragapati, he parts for the wife, who is seated to the west of the fire on a soft chair, her hair upwards (i.e. beginning from the front) with a bunch containing an even number of unripe Udumbara fruits, and with three bunches of Darbha grass, with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, with a stick of Viratara wood, and with a full spindle. with the words, 'Bhur bhuvah svah.'
1.15.5 Or (he parts the hair once) with each of the (three) Mahavyahritis.
1.15.6 [*6]. He ties (the Udumbara fruits, &c.) to a string of three twisted threads with (the words), 'Rich in sap is this tree; like the tree, rich in sap, be thou fruitful.'
1.15.7 [*7]. (The husband) then says to two lute-players, 'Sing ye the king, or if anybody else is still more valiant.'
1.15.8 [*8]. Here some also prescribe a certain stanza (to be sung by the lute-players): 'Soma alone is our king. May these human tribes dwell on thy banks, O (river) whose dominion is unbroken, N.N.!'--here he names the name of the river near which they dwell.
1.15.9 Then (follows) feeding of the Brahmanas.


1.16.1 [*1]. Soshyantim adbhir abhyukshaty egatu dasamasya iti (Vag. Samh. VIII, 28) prag yasyai to iti (ibid. 29).
1.16.2 [*2] Athavaravapatanam, avaitu prisni sevalam sune garayv attave, naiva mamsena pivari na kasmims kanayatam ava garayu padyatam iti.
1.16.3 When the boy is born, he performs for him, before the navel-string is cut off, the medhaganana (production of intelligence) and the ayushya (rite for procuring long life).
1.16.4 [*4]. (The medhaganana is performed in the following way:) With his fourth finger and with (an instrument of) gold he gives (to the child) honey and ghee, or ghee (alone), to eat with (the formulas), 'Bhuh I put into thee; bhuvah I put into thee; svah I put into thee. Bhur bhuvah svah everything I put into thee.'
1.16.5 He then performs the ayushya.
1.16.6 Near his navel or his right ear he murmurs: 'Agni is long-lived; through the trees he is long-lived. By that long life I make thee long-lived. 'Soma is long-lived; through the herbs he is, &c. 'The Brahman is long-lived; through the Brahmanas it is, &c. 'The gods are long-lived; through ambrosia (amrita) they are, &c. 'The Rishis are long-lived; through their observances they are, &c. 'The Fathers are long-lived; through the Svadha oblations (or oblations made to the Manes) they are, &c. 'Sacrifice is long-lived; through sacrificial fee it is, &c. 'The ocean is long-lived; through the rivers it is long-lived. By that long life I make thee long-lived;'
1.16.7 And three times the verse, 'The threefold age' (Vag. Samh. III, 62).
1.16.8 If he desires, 'May he live his full term of life,' he should touch him with the Vatsapra hymn (Vag. Samh. XII, 18-29).
1.16.9 From the Anuvaka beginning with 'From heaven' (XII, 18 seqq.) he omits the last Rik (XII, 29).
1.16.10 Having placed five Brahmanas towards the (five) regions, he should say to them, 'Breathe ye upon this (child).'
1.16.11 [*11]. The (Brahmana placed) to the east should say, Up-breathing!
1.16.12 The one to the south, 'Back-breathing!'
1.16.13 The one to the west, 'Down-breathing!'
1.16.14 The one to the north, 'Out-breathing!'
1.16.15 The fifth one, looking upwards, should say, 'On-breathing!'
1.16.16 Or (the father) may do that himself, going round (his child), if he can find no (Brahmanas).
1.16.17 [*17]. He recites over the place at which (the child) is born: 'I know, O earth, thy heart that dwells in heaven, in the moon. That I know; may it know me. May we see a hundred autumns; may we live a hundred autumns; may we hear a hundred autumns.'
1.16.18 [*18]. He then touches him with (the verse), 'Be a stone, be an axe, be imperishable gold. Thou indeed art the Self called son; thus live a hundred autumns.'
1.16.19 [*19]. He then recites over his mother (the verse), 'Thou art Ida, the daughter of Mitra and Varuna; thou strong woman hast born a strong son. Be thou blessed with strong children, thou who hast blessed us with a strong son.'
1.16.20 He then washes her right breast, and gives it to the child with (the verse), 'This breast' (Vag. Samh. XVII, 87);
1.16.21 [*21]. The left (breast) with (the verse), 'Thy breast which' (ibid. XXXVIII, 5)--with these two (verses).
1.16.22 He puts down a pot of water near her head with (the verse), 'O waters, you watch with the gods. As you watch with the gods, thus watch over this mother who is confined, and her child.'
1.16.23 [*23]. Having established near the door the fire that has been kept from (the wife's) confinement, he throws into that fire at the time of the morning and evening twilight, until (the mother) gets up (from childbed), mustard seeds mixed with rice chaff (pronouncing the following names of demons and goblins): 'May Sanda and Marka, Upavira, Saundikeya, Ulukhala, Malimluka, Dronasa, Kyavana vanish hence. Svaha! 'May Alikhat, Animisha, Kimvadanta, Upasruti, Haryaksha, Kumbhin, Satru, Patrapani, Nrimani, Hantrimukha, Sarshaparuna, Kyavana vanish hence. Svaha!'
1.16.24 [*24]. If (the demon bringing disease) Kumara attacks the boy, the father covers him with a net or with an upper garment, takes him on his lap, and murmurs: Kurkura, Sukurkura, Kurkura, who holds fast children. Ket! ket! doggy! let him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sisara, barker, bender. 'That is true that the gods have given a boon to thee. Hast thou then chosen even this boy? 'Ket! ket! doggy! let him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sisara, barker, bender. 'That is true that (the divine she-dog) Sarama is thy mother, Sisara thy father, the black and the speckled (two dogs of Yama) thy brothers. 'Ket! ket! doggy! let him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sisara, barker, bender.'
1.16.25 He then touches (the boy) with (the words), 'He does not suffer, he does not cry, he is not stiff, he is not sick, when we speak to him and when we touch him.'

1.17.1 [*1]. On the tenth day (after the birth of the child) the father, having made (his wife) get up, and having fed the Brahmanas, gives a name (to the child),
1.17.2 Of two syllables, or of four syllables beginning with a sonant, with a semivowel in it, with a long vowel (or) the Visarga (at its end), with a Krit (suffix), not with a Taddhita;
1.17.3 With an uneven number of syllables, ending in a, with a Taddhita (suffix) to a girl.
1.17.4 (The name) of a Brahmana (should end in) sarman (for inst. Vishnusarman), that of a Kshatriya in varman (for inst. Lakshmivarman), that of a Vaisya in gupta (for inst. Kandragupta).
1.17.5 In the forth month (follows) the going out.
1.17.6 He makes (the child) look at the sun, pronouncing (the verse), 'That eye' (Vag. Samhita XXXVI, 24).

1.18.1 [*1]. When he returns from a journey, he approaches his house in the manner stated above.
1.18.2 When he sees his son, he murmurs, 'From limb by limb thou art produced; out of the heart thou art born. Thou indeed art the Self called son; so live a hundred autumns!'
1.18.3 He then kisses his head with (the words), 'With the himkara (the mystical syllable hin) of Pragapati, which gives thousandfold life, I kiss thee, N.N.! Live a hundred autumns!'--
1.18.4 And three times with (the words), 'With the himkara of the cows.'
1.18.5 [*5]. In his right ear he murmurs, 'Bestow on us, O bountiful, onward-pressing Indra, plentiful, rich treasures. Give us a hundred autumns to live; give us many heroes, strong jawed Indra;'
1.18.6 [*6]. In the left ear, 'Indra, bestow on us the best treasures, insight of mind, happiness, increase of wealth, health of our bodies, sweetness of speech, and that our days may be good days.'
1.18.7 For a girl he only kisses the head silently.

1.19.1 In the sixth month the Annaprasana (or first feeding with solid food).
1.19.2 [*2]. Having cooked a mess of sacrificial food, and sacrificed the two Agyabhagas, he offers two Agya oblations, (the first with the verse,) 'The gods have generated the goddess Speech; manifold animals speak her forth. May she, the sweet-sounding, the cow that (for milk) gives sap and juice to us, Speech, the highly-praised one, come to us. Svaha!'
1.19.3 And the second (oblation) with (the verse), 'May vigour us to-day' (Vag. Samhita XVIII, 33).
1.19.4 He then sacrifices (four oblations) of cooked food with (the formulas), 'Through up-breathing may I enjoy food. Svaha! 'Through down-breathing may I enjoy smells. Svaha! 'Through my eye may I enjoy visible things. Svaha! 'Through my ear may I enjoy renown. Svaha!'
1.19.5 After he has eaten (himself), he should set apart food of all kinds, and of all different sorts of flavour, and should give it to him (i.e. to his son) to eat,
1.19.6 [*6]. Silently or with (the word), 'Hanta' (i.e. Well!). For it is said in the Sruti, 'Men (live on) the word hanta.'
1.19.7 (He feeds the child) with flesh of (the bird called) Bharadvagi, if he wishes (to the child) fluency of speech,
1.19.8 With flesh of partridge, if abundance of nourishment,

1.19.9 With fish, if swiftness,
1.19.10 (With flesh) of (the bird) Krikasha, if long life,
1.19.11 (With flesh) of (the bird) Ati, if desirous of holy lustre,
1.19.12 With all, if desirous of all.
1.19.13 Or each (sort of) food one by one. Then (follows) feeding of the Brahmanas, or each (sort of) food one by one. Then feeding of the Brahmanas.

2.1.1 [*1]. When (the son) is one year old, the Kudakarana (i.e. the tonsure of his head, should be performed),
2.1.2 Or before the lapse of the third (year).
2.1.3 When he is sixteen years old, the Kesanta (i.e. the shaving of his beard, is to be done),
2.1.4 Or, according as it is considered auspicious by all (the different families).
2.1.5 After food has been distributed to the Brahmanas, the mother takes the boy, bathes him, puts on him an under and an upper garment which have not yet been washed, and putting him on her lap, she sits down to the west of the fire.
2.1.6 The father taking hold (of his wife) sacrifices Agya oblations, and after he has partaken of the (sacrificial) food, he pours warm water into cold water with (the words), 'With warm water come hither, Vayu! Aditi, cut the hair.'
2.1.7 At the Kesanta ceremony (Sutra 3), 'hair and beard' (instead of 'hair').
2.1.8 He throws a piece of fresh butter, or of ghee, or some curds into it (i.e. into the water, Sara 6).
2.1.9 [*9]. Taking some (water) he moistens the hair near the right ear with (the formula), 'On the impulse of Savitri may the divine waters moisten thy body in order that long life and splendour may be thine.'
2.1.10 [*10]. Having unravelled (the hair) with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, he puts three young Kusa shoots into it with (the formula), 'Herb' (Vag. Samh. IV, 1).
2.1.11 [*11]. Taking up a copper razor with (the formula), 'Friendly by name' (Vag. Samh. III, 63 a), he cuts (the hair) with (the formula), 'I cut off' (ibid. 63b), (and with the formula,) 'The razor with which Savitri, the knowing one, has shaven (the beard) of king Soma and Varuna, with that, ye Brahmanas, shave his (head), in order that he may be blessed with long life and may reach old age.'
2.1.12 Cutting off (the Kusa shoots) together with the hair, he throws them on a lump of bull's dung which they keep northwards of the fire.
2.1.13 In the same way two other times silently.
2.1.14 The moistening and the other rites are repeated with the two other (tufts of hair).
2.1.15 Behind with (the verse), 'The threefold age' (Vag. Samh. III, 62).
2.1.16 [*16]. Then on the left side with (the verse), 'With that prayer by which mayst thou, a mighty one, go to heaven, and long mayst thou see the sun: with that prayer I shave thee for the sake of life, of existence, of glory, of welfare.'
2.1.17 Three times he shaves round the head, from left to right;
2.1.18 Including the face, at the Kesanta ceremony.
2.1.19 [*19]. (He recites the verse,) 'When the shaver shaves his hair with the razor, the wounding, the well-shaped, purify his head, but do not take away his life.'
2.1.20 [*20]. He adds (the word), 'his face' at the Kesanta ceremony.
2.1.21 With that water (Sutras 6, 8) he moistens his head, and gives the razor to the barber with (the words), 'Without wounding him, shave him.'
2.1.22 The locks of hair which are left over, are to be arranged as it is considered auspicious (in his family).
2.1.23 [*23]. Having put away that lump of dung with the hair so that it is hidden in a cow-stable, or in a small pond, or in the vicinity of water; he gives an optional gift to the teacher;
2.1.24 A cow at the Kesanta ceremony.
2.1.25 After the Kesanta has been performed, (the youth) should observe chastity and should not be shaven through one year, or twelve nights, or six nights, or at least three nights.


2.2.1 He should initiate a Brahmana, when he is eight years old, or in the eighth year after the conception,
2.2.2 Asvalayana, when he is eleven years old,

2.2.3 A Vaisya, when he is twelve years old.
2.2.4 Or according as it is considered auspicious by all (the different families).
2.2.5 He should feed the Brahmanas. And they lead him (i.e. the boy who is to be initiated) on, with his head shaven all round, and decked with ornaments.
2.2.6 [*6]. (The teacher) makes him place himself to the west of the fire and say, 'I have come hither for the sake of studentship (brahmakarya).' And, 'I will be a student (brahmakarin).'
2.2.7 He then makes him put on a garment with (the verse), 'In the way in which Brihaspati put the garment of immortality on Indra, thus I put (this garment) on thee, for the sake of long life, of old age, of strength, of splendour.'
2.2.8 [*8]. He ties round him the girdle with (the verse which the youth recites), 'Here has come to me, keeping away evil words, purifying my kind as a , clothing herself, by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation, with strength, this sisterly goddess, this blessed girdle.'
2.2.9 [*9]. Or, 'A youth, well attired, dressed, came hither. He, being born, becomes glorious. Wise sages extol him, devout ones, turning their minds to the gods.'
2.2.10 Or silently.
2.2.11 He gives him the staff.
2.2.12 (The student) accepts it with (the verse), 'My staff which fell down to the ground in the open air, that I take up again for the sake of long life, of holiness, of holy lustre.'
2.2.13 [*13]. According to some (teachers he accepts the staff) in the way prescribed for the inauguration, because it is said, 'He enters upon a long Sattra (or sacrificial period).'
2.2.14 (The teacher) then with his joined hands fills (the student's) joined hands with water with the three (verses), 'Ye waters are' (Vag. Samh. XI, 50 seqq.).
2.2.15 [*15]. He then makes him look at the sun with (the verse), 'That eye' (Vag. Samh. XXXVI, 24).
2.2.16 [*16]. He then touches his heart, (reaching) over his right shoulder, with (the words), 'Into my will I take thy heart, &c.'
2.2.17 [*17]. He then seizes (the student's) right hand and says, 'What is thy name?
2.2.18 He replies, 'I am N.N., sir!'
2.2.19 He then says to him, 'Whose pupil (brahmakarin) art thou?'
2.2.20 [*20]. After (the student) has said, 'Yours!'--(the teacher replies,) 'Indra's pupil art thou; Agni is thy teacher; I am thy teacher, N.N.!'
2.2.21 He then gives him in charge to living beings with (the formulas), 'To Pragapati I give thee in charge. To the god Savitri I give thee in charge. To the waters, the herbs I give thee in charge. To Heaven and Earth I give thee in charge. To the Visve devas I give thee in charge. To all beings I give thee in charge for the sake of freedom from harm.'

2.3.1 [*1]. Having walked round the fire with his right side turned towards it, he sits down.
2.3.2 Taking hold (of the student), he sacrifices the Agya oblations, and after having partaken (of the remains of the sacrificial food) he instructs him, 'A student art thou. Take water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time. Keep silence. Put fuel on (the fire). Take water.'
2.3.3 He then recites the Savitri to him, who is seated to the north of the fire, with his face to the west, sitting near the teacher, and looks (at the teacher), while (the teacher) looks at him;
2.3.4 [*4]. Some say, to (the student) who is standing or seated to the south (of the fire);
2.3.5 Pada by Pada, (then) hemistich by hemistich, and the third time the whole (verse), reciting it together (with the student);

2.3.6 After one year, or after six months, or after twenty-four days, or after twelve days, or after six days, or after three days.
2.3.7 [*7]. To a Brahmana, however, he should recite a (Savitri) verse in the Gayatri metre immediately. For it is said in the Sruti, 'To Agni indeed belongs the Brahmana.'
2.3.8 A Trishtubh verse to a Raganya,
2.3.9 A Gagati to a Vaisya,
2.3.10 Or a Gayatri to (persons of) all (castes).

2.4.1 Now the putting on of fuel.
2.4.2 [*2]. He wipes with his hand (the ground) round the fire with (the formula), 'Agni, glorious one, make me glorious. As thou, glorious Agni, art glorious, thus, O glorious one, bring me to glory. As thou, Agni, art the preserver of the treasure of sacrifice for the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure of the Veda for men.'
2.4.3 [*3]. Having sprinkled (water) round the fire from left to right, he stands up and puts a piece of wood on (the fire) with (the texts), 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great Gatavedas. As thou, Agni, art inflamed by wood, thus I am inflamed by life, insight, vigour, offspring, cattle, holy lustre. 'May my teacher be the father of living sons; may I be full of insight, not forgetful (of what I have learned); may I become full of glory, of splendour, of holy lustre, an enjoyer of food. Svaha!

2.4.4 In the same way (he puts on) a second (piece of wood); and thus a third.
2.4.5 Or (each piece) with (the verse), 'Thine is this' (Vag. Samh. II, 14).
2.4.6 Or (he uses) both (this verse and the formulas given in Sutra 3).
2.4.7 [*7]. The wiping and sprinkling (of water) round (the fire are repeated) as above.
2.4.8 Having warmed his two hands, he wipes his mouth with (the formulas): 'Agni, thou art the protector of bodies. Protect my body. Agni, thou art the giver of life. Give me life. Agni, thou art the giver of vigour. Give me vigour. 'Agni, what is deficient in my body, that restore to fulness. 'May the god Savitri bestow insight on me, may the goddess Sarasvati, may the two divine Asvins, wreathed with lotus, (bestow) insight (on me).'

2.5.1 Here (follows the student's) going the rounds for alms.
2.5.2 [*2-4]. A Brahmana should beg, addressing (the woman from whom he begs alms) with the word 'Lady' put at the beginning (of his request),
2.5.3 A Raganya, with the word 'Lady' inserted in the middle,
2.5.4 A Vaisya, with the word 'Lady' put at the end.
2.5.5 [*5]. (He should beg) from three women who will not refuse;

2.5.6 From six, twelve, or an indefinite number.
2.5.7 From his own mother first, according to some (teachers).
2.5.8 [*8]. Having announced the alms received to his teacher, he should stand, keeping silence, through the rest of the day, according to some.
2.5.9 [*9]. Having fetched fire-wood out of the forest without damaging (trees), he should put them on that fire as above, and should abandon his silence.
2.5.10 He should sleep on the ground and eat no pungent or saline food.
2.5.11 Wearing the staff, worshipping the fire, being obedient to his Guru, going the rounds for alms--(these are the standing duties of students).
2.5.12 [*12]. He should avoid honey or flesh, bathing (for pleasure), sitting on high seats, going to women, falsehood, and taking what is not given to him.
2.5.13 [*13-15]. Let him live forty-eight years as a student for the (four) Vedas,
2.5.14 Or twelve years for each Veda,
2.5.15 Or until he has learnt it.
2.5.16 The garment (of a student) should be made of hemp, flax, or wool (accordingly as he is a Brahmana, a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya).
2.5.17 The upper garment of a Brahmana should be an antelope-skin,
2.5.18 That of a Raganya the skin of a spotted deer,

2.5.19 That of a Vaisya a goat's or cow's skin.
2.5.20 Or if (the prescribed sort of garment) is not to be had, a cow's hide (should be worn) by all, because to that belongs the first place (among all kinds of garments).
2.5.21 The girdle of a Brahmana should be of Munga grass,
2.5.22 That of a Kshatriya should be a bowstring,
2.5.23 That of a Vaisya, made of Murva (i.e. Sanseveria Roxburghiana).
2.5.24 [*24]. If there is no Munga (or the other articles prescribed in  section section 22, 23, the girdles should be made) of Kusa grass, of the plant Asmantaka, or of Balbaga grass (respectively).
2.5.25 The staff of a Brahmana is of Palasa wood,
2.5.26 That of a Raganya of Bilva wood,
2.5.27 That of a Vaisya of Udumbara wood.
2.5.28 Or all (sorts of staffs may be used) by all.
2.5.29 If the teacher calls him, he shall rise and then answer..
2.5.30 If (the teacher calls him) while he is lying down, (he should answer) sitting; if sitting, standing; if standing, walking up (to the teacher); if walking up, running up.
2.5.31 If he behaves thus, his fame when he has become a Snataka (i.e. when he has taken the bath at the end of his studentship) will be (such that people will say of him), 'To-day he stays there; to-day he stays there.'
2.5.32 [*32-35]. There are three (kinds of) Snatakas: a Vidya-snataka (i.e. a Snataka by knowledge), a Vrata-snataka (i.e. a Snataka by the completion of his vows), and a Vidya-vrata-snataka (i.e. a Snataka both by knowledge and by the completion of his vows).
2.5.33 He who performs the Samavartana ceremony, after having finished the study of the Veda, but before the time of his vows has expired, is a Vidya-snataka.
2.5.34 He who performs the Samavartana, after his vows have expired, but before he has finished the study of the Veda, is a Vrata-snataka.
2.5.35 He who performs the Samavartana, after having finished both, is a Vidya-vrata-snataka.
2.5.36 [*36-40]. Until the sixteenth year the time (for being initiated) has not passed for a Brahmana,
2.5.37 Until the twenty-second for a Raganya,
2.5.38 Until the twenty-fourth for a Vaisya.
2.5.39 After that (time has passed), they become patitasavitrika (or persons who have lost the right of learning the Savitri).
2.5.40 No one should initiate such men, nor teach them, nor perform sacrifices for them, nor have intercourse with them.
2.5.41 [*41]. After the time has passed, (they should do) as has been prescribed.
2.5.42 [*42]. A person whose ancestors through three generations have been patitasavitrikas, is excluded from the sacrament (of initiation) and from being taught the Veda.
2.5.43 [*43]. Of such persons those who desire to receive the sacrament, may perform the sacrifice of Vratyastoma and then study the Veda, if they like. For (of persons who have done that) it is said, 'Intercourse with them is permitted.'

2.6.1 When he has finished the Veda, he should take the bath (by which he becomes a Snataka);
2.6.2 [*2]. Or when (he has gone through) a studentship of forty-eight years;
2.6.3 [*3]. Or also after (a studentship) of twelve years, according to some (teachers).
2.6.4 (Let him take the bath only) if his Guru has given his permission.
2.6.5 [*5]. Rules (regarding the performance of sacrifices), (texts) to be used (at the sacrifices according to those rules), and reasoning (on the meaning of the rites and texts): that is the Veda.
2.6.6 [*6]. Some say (that the Veda should be studied) with its six Angas;

2.6.7 Not so that he only knows the ceremonial.
2.6.8 But optionally by one who knows the sacrifices (the bath may be taken).
2.6.9 (The student) after having embraced (the feet of) his teacher, and put the pieces of wood on the fire, places himself northwards of an enclosure, on eastward-pointed Kusa grass, to the east of eight vessels with water.
2.6.10 [*10]. 'The fires that dwell in the waters; the fire which must be hidden, the fire which must be covered, the ray of light, the fire which kills the mind, the unwavering one, the pain-causing one, the destroyer of the body, the fire which kills the organs--those I leave behind. The shining one, that I seize here'--with (this formula) he draws water out of one (of the eight vessels);
2.6.11 With that he besprinkles himself with (the words), 'Therewith I besprinkle myself for the sake of prosperity, of glory, of holiness, of holy lustre.'
2.6.12 [*12]. (A second time he draws water out of a second of the eight vessels with the formula given in Sutra 10, putting instead of the words, 'The shining one, &c.,' the verse): 'By which you have created prosperity, by which you have touched sura, with which you have anointed the eyes, which is your' glory, O Asvins.'

2.6.13 (And he draws water out of three other vessels) with (the three verses), 'Ye waters are' (Vag. Samh. XI, 50-52), verse by verse.
2.6.14 With (water drawn out of) the three other (vessels he besprinkles himself) silently.
2.6.15 Having loosened his girdle with (the verse), 'The highest band' (Vag. Samh. XII, 12), having put it down, having put on another garment, he worships the sun--
2.6.16 [*16]. With (the formulas), 'Rising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with the gods who walk in the morning. Thou art a tenfold winner; make me a tenfold winner. Make me attain to renown. Rising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with the gods who walk in day-time. Thou art a hundredfold winner; make me a hundredfold winner. Make me attain to renown. Rising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with the gods who walk in the evening. Thou art a thousandfold winner; make me a thousandfold winner. Make me attain to renown.'
2.6.17 Having eaten curds or sesamum seeds, and having had his matted hair, the hair of his body, and his nails cut, he should cleanse his teeth with an Udumbara branch with (the verse), 'Array yourselves for the enjoyment of food. Here has come king Soma: he will purify my mouth with glory and fortune.'
2.6.18 Having anointed himself and bathed again, he takes up the salve for nose and mouth with (the words), 'Satiate my up-breathing and down-breathing; satiate my eye; satiate my ear!'
2.6.19 Having poured out to the south the water with which he has washed his hands, with (the words), 'Ye fathers, become pure,' he should salve himself and murmur, 'May I become well-looking with my eyes, well-shining with my face, well-hearing with my ears.'

2.11.11 Or six months and a half.
2.11.12 [*12]. They then mutter this Rik: 'Ye two young sages! The relation which has expired among us, the friendship we dissolve, (turning away) from the condition of friendship.'
2.11.13 After having remained together through a period of three nights, they separate.

2.12.1 [*1]. In (the month) Pausha, under (the Nakshatra) Rohini, or at the middle Ashtaka let them celebrate the conclusion of the study (of the Veda).

10. Having driven a moment beyond (the point to which he intends to go) he should murmur, 'Here is rest, rest here' (Vag. Samh. VIII, 51).
11 [*11]. Some add (the words), 'Here shall be no rest.'
12. If the chariot is weak, he should murmur, after he has mounted it, 'May this your chariot, O Asvins, suffer no damage on bad ways or by being overthrown.'
13 [*13]. If the horses run away with the chariot, he should touch the post (?) or the earth and should murmur, 'May this your chariot, O Asvins, suffer no damage on bad ways or by being overthrown.'
14. Thus he will suffer no harm and no damage.
15 [*15]. When he has finished his way, and has unyoked the horses, let him have grass and water given to them. 'For thus satisfaction is given to the beast that draws (the cart)'--says the Sruti.

22. If he receives something (given to him), he accepts it with (the formula), 'May Heaven give thee; may the Earth accept thee.' Thus (the thing given) does not decrease to him who gives it, and what he receives increases.

1.1.1 We shall explain the Upanayana (i.e. the initiation of the student).
1.1.2 [*2] Let him initiate a Brahmana at the age of seven years,
1.1.3 A Raganya, of eleven, a Vaisya, of twelve.
1.1.4 [*4] A Brahmana in the spring, a Raganya in the summer, a Vaisya in the autumn.
1.1.5 In the time of the increasing moon, under an auspicious constellation, preferably (under a constellation) the name of which is masculine,
1.1.6 [*6] He should serve food to an even number of Brahmanas and should cause them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!'--
1.1.7 (Then he) should have the boy satiated, should have his hair shaven, and after (the boy) has bathed and has been decked with ornaments--
1.1.8 He should dress him in a (new) garment which has not yet been washed.
1.1.9 [*9] In a place inclined towards the east, (or) inclined towards the north, (or) inclined towards northeast, or in an even (place), he raises (the surface on which he intends to sacrifice), sprinkles it with water,
1.1.10 Kindles fire by attrition, or fetches common (worldly) fire, puts the fire down, and puts wood on the fire.
1.1.11 [*11] He strews eastward-pointed Darbha grass round the fire;
1.1.12 Or (the grass which is strewn) to the west and to the east (of the fire), may be northward-pointed.
1.1.13 [*13] He (arranges the Darbha blades so as to) lay the southern (blades) uppermost, the northern ones below, if their points are turned (partly) towards the east and (partly) towards the north.
1.1.14 [*14] Having strewn Darbha grass, to the south of the fire, in the place destined for the Brahman,
1.1.15 [*15] Having with the two (verses), 'I take (the fire) to myself,' and, 'The fire which (has entered)'--taken possession of the fire,
1.1.16 [*16] And having, to the north of the fire, spread out Darbha grass, he prepares the (following) objects, according as they are required (for the ceremony which he is going to perform):
1.1.17 [*17] A stone, a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, a skin (of an antelope, or a spotted deer, &c.), a threefold-twisted girdle of Munga grass if he is a Brahmana (who shall be initiated), a bowstring for a Raganya, a woollen thread for a Vaisya, a staff of Bilva or of Palasa wood for a Brahmana, of Nyagrodha wood for a Raganya, of Udumbara wood for a Vaisya.
1.1.18 [*18] He binds together the fuel, twenty-one pieces of wood, or as many as there are oblations to be made.
1.1.19 Together with that fuel he ties up the (three) branches of wood which are to be laid round the fire, (which should have the shape of) pegs.
1.1.20 [*20] (He gets ready, besides, the spoon called) Darvi, a bunch of grass, the Agya pot, the pot for the Pranita water, and whatever (else) is required;
1.1.21 All (those objects) together, or (one after the other) as it happens.
1.1.22 [*22] At that time the Brahman suspends the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, sips water, passes by the fire, on its west side, to the south side, throws away a grass blade from the Brahman's seat, touches water, and sits down with his face turned towards the fire.
1.1.23 [*23] He takes as 'purifiers' two straight Darbha blades with unbroken points of one span's length, cuts them off with something else than his nail, wipes them with water, pours water into a vessel over which he has laid the purifiers, fills (that vessel) up to near the brim, purifies (the water) three times with the two Darbha strainers, holding their points to the north, places (the water) on Darbha grass on the north side of the fire, and covers it with Darbha grass.
1.1.24 [*24] Having consecrated the Prokshani water by means of the purifiers as before, having placed the vessels upright, and having untied the fuel, he sprinkles (the sacrificial vessels) three times with the whole (Prokshani water).
1.1.25 [*25] Having warmed the Darvi spoon (over the fire), having wiped it, and warmed it again, he puts it down.
1.1.26 Having besprinkled (with water) the Darbha grass with which the fuel was tied together, he throws it into the fire.
1.1.27 [*27] He melts the Agya, pours the Agya into the Agya pot over which he has laid the purifiers, takes some coals (from the fire) towards the north, puts (the Agya) on these (coals), throws light (on the Agya by means of burning Darbha blades), throws two young Darbha shoots into it, moves a fire-brand round it three times, takes it (from the coals) towards the north, pushes the coals back (into the fire), purifies the Agya three times with the two purifiers, holding their points towards the north, (drawing them through the Agya from west to east and) taking them back (to the west each time), throws the two purifiers into the fire,
1.2.1 [*1] And lays the (three) pegs round (the fire).
1.2.2 On the west side (of the fire) he places the middle (peg), with its broad end to the north,
1.2.3 On the south side (of the fire the second peg), so that it touches the middle one, with its broad end to the east,
1.2.4 On the north side (of the fire the third peg), so that it touches the middle one, with its broad end to the east.
1.2.5 To the west of the fire (the teacher who is going to initiate the student), sits down with his face turned towards the east.
1.2.6 To the south (of the teacher) the boy, wearing the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, having sipped water, sits down and touches (the teacher).
1.2.7 [*7] Then (the teacher) sprinkles water round the fire (in the following way):
1.2.8 On the south side (of the fire he sprinkles water) from west to east with (the words), 'Aditi! Give thy consent!'--
1.2.9 On the west side, from south to north, with (the words), 'Anumati! Give thy consent!' On the north side, from west to east, with (the words), 'Sarasvati! Give thy consent!'--
1.2.10 On all sides, so as to keep his right side turned towards (the fire), with (the Mantra), 'God Savitri! Give thy impulse!' (Taitt. Samh. I, 7, 7, 1).
1.2.11 [*11] Having (thus) sprinkled (water) round (the fire), and having anointed the fuel (with Agya), he puts it on (the fire) with (the Mantra), 'This fuel is thy self, Gatavedas! Thereby thou shalt be inflamed and shalt grow. Inflame us and make us grow; through offspring, cattle, holy lustre, and through the enjoyment of food make us increase. Svaha!'
1.2.12 He then sacrifices with the (spoon called) Darvi (the following oblations):
1.2.13 [*13] Approaching the Darvi (to the fire) by the northerly junction of the pegs (laid round the fire), and fixing his mind on (the formula), 'To Pragapati, to Manu svaha!' (without pronouncing that Mantra), he sacrifices a straight, long, uninterrupted (stream of Agya), directed towards the south-east.
1.2.14 Approaching the Darvi (to the fire) by the southern junction of the pegs (laid round the fire), (he sacrifices) a straight (stream of Agya), directed towards the northeast, with (the Mantra which he pronounces), 'To Indra svaha!'
1.2.15 Having (thus) poured out the two Aghara oblations, he sacrifices the two Agyabhagas,
1.2.16 [*16] With (the words), 'To Agni svaha!' over the easterly part of the northerly part (of the fire); with (the words), 'To Soma svaha!' over the easterly part of the southerly part (of the fire).
1.2.17 [*17] Between them he sacrifices the other (oblations).
1.2.18 [*18] (He makes four oblations with the following Mantras): 'Thou whom we have set to work, Gatavedas! carry forward (our offerings). Agni! Perceive this work (i.e. the sacrifice), as it is performed (by us). Thou art a healer, a creator of medicine. Through thee may we obtain cows, horses, and men. Svaha! Thou who liest down athwart, thinking, "It is I who keep (all things) asunder:" to thee who art propitious (to me), I sacrifice this stream of ghee in the fire. Svaha! To the propitious goddess svaha! To the accomplishing goddess svaha!'
1.3.1 This is the rite for all Darvi-sacrifices.
1.3.2 [*2] At the end of the Mantras constantly the word Svaha (is pronounced).
1.3.3 [*3] (Oblations) for which no Mantras are prescribed (are made merely with the words), 'To such and such (a deity) svaha!'--according to the deity (to whom the oblation is made).
1.3.4 [*4] He sacrifices with the Vyahritis, 'Bhuh! Bhuvah! Suvah!'--with the single (three Vyahritis) and with (the three) together.
1.3.5 [*5] (The Mantras for the two chief oblations are), the (verse), 'Life-giving, Agni!' (Taitt. Brahmana I, 2, 1, 11), (and), 'Life-giving, O god, choosing long life, thou whose face is full of ghee, whose back is full of ghee, Agni, drinking ghee, the noble ambrosia that comes from the cow, lead this (boy) to old age, as a father (leads) his son. Svaha!'
1.3.6 (Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varuna' (Taitt. Samh. II, 1, 11, 6), 'For this I entreat thee' (Taitt. Samh., loc. cit.), 'Thou, Agni' (Taitt. Samh. II, 5, 12, 3), 'Thus thou, Agni' (Taitt. Samh., loc. cit.), 'Thou, Agni, art quick. Being quick, appointed (by us) in our mind (as our messenger), thou who art quick, earnest the offering (to the gods). O quick one, bestow medicine on us! Svaha!'--(and finally) the (verse), 'Pragapati!' (Taitt. Samh. I, 8, 14, 2).
1.3.7 [*7] (With the verse), 'What I have done too much in this sacrifice, or what I have done here deficiently, all that may Agni Svishtakrit, he who knows it, make well sacrificed and well offered for me. To Agni Svishtakrit, the offerer of well-offered (sacrifices), the offerer of everything, to him who makes us succeed in our offerings and in our wishes, svaha!'--he offers (the Svishtakrit oblation) over the easterly part of the northerly part (of the fire), separated from the other oblations.
1.3.8 [*8] Here some add as subordinate oblations, before the Svishtakrit, the Gaya, Abhyatana, and Rashtrabhrit (oblations).
1.3.9 [*9] The Gaya (oblations) he sacrifices with (the thirteen Mantras), 'Thought, svaha! Thinking, svaha!'--or, 'To thought svaha! To thinking svaha!' (&c.);
1.3.10 [*10] The Abhyatana (oblations) with (the eighteen Mantras), 'Agni is the lord of beings; may he protect me' (&c.).
1.3.11 [*11] (The words), 'In this power of holiness, in this worldly power (&c.)' are added to (each section of) the Abhyatana formulas.
1.3.12 [*12] With (the last of the Abhyatana formulas) 'Fathers! Grandfathers!' he sacrifices or performs worship, wearing the sacrificial cord over his right shoulder.
1.3.13 [*13] The Rashtrabhrit (oblations he sacrifices) with (the twelve Mantras), 'The champion of truth, he whose law is truth.' After having quickly repeated (each) section, he sacrifices the first oblation with (the words), 'To him svaha!' the second (oblation) with (the words), 'To them svaha!'
1.3.14 [*14] Having placed a stone near the northerly junction of the pegs (which are laid round the fire), (the teacher)--
1.4.1 [*1] Makes the boy tread on (that stone) with his right foot, with (the verse), 'Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm. Destroy those who seek to do thee harm; overcome thy enemies.'
1.4.2 [*2] After (the boy) has taken off his old (garment), (the teacher) makes him put on a (new) garment that has not yet been washed, with (the verses), 'The goddesses who spun, who wove, who spread out, and who drew out the skirts on both sides, may those goddesses clothe thee with long life. Blessed with life put on this garment. 'Dress him; through (this) garment make him reach a hundred (years) of age; extend his life. Brihaspati has given this garment to king Soma that he may put it on. 'Mayst thou live to old age; put on the garment! Be a protector of the human tribes against imprecation. Live a hundred years, full of vigour; clothe thyself in the increase of wealth.'
1.4.3 [*3] Having (thus) made (the boy) put on (the new garment, the teacher) recites over him (the verse), 'Thou hast put on this garment for the sake of welfare; thou hast become a protector of thy friends against imprecation. Live a hundred long years; a noble man, blessed with life, mayst thou distribute wealth.'
1.4.4 [*4] He then winds the girdle three times from left to right round (the boy, so that it covers) his navel. (He does so only) twice, according to some (teachers). (It is done) with (the verse), 'Here she has come to us who drives away sin, purifying our guard and our protection, bringing us strength by (the power of) inhalation and exhalation, the sister of the gods, this blessed girdle.'
1.4.5 On the north side of the navel he makes a threefold knot (in the girdle) and draws that to the south side of the navel.
1.4.6 [*6] He then arranges for him the skin (of an antelope, &c., see Sutra 7) as an outer garment, with (the Mantras), 'The firm, strong eye of Mitra, glorious splendour, powerful and flaming, a chaste, mobile vesture, this skin put on, a valiant (man), N.N.!' 'May Aditi tuck up thy garment, that thou mayst study the Veda, for the sake of insight and belief and of not forgetting what thou hast learnt, for the sake of holiness and of holy lustre!'
1.4.7 [*7] The skin of a black antelope (is worn) by a Brahmana, the skin of a spotted deer by a Raganya, the skin of a he-goat by a Vaisya.
1.4.8 [*8] He then gives him in charge (to the gods), a Brahmana with (the verse), 'We give this (boy) in charge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great learning. May he (Brahman?) lead him to old age, and may he (the boy) long watch over learning.' A Raganya (he gives in charge to the gods) with (the verse), 'We give this boy in charge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great royalty. May he lead him to old age, and may he long watch over royalty.' A Vaisya (he gives in charge) with (the verse), 'We give this boy in charge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great wealth. May he lead him to old age, and may he long watch over wealth.'
1.4.9 [*9] (The teacher) makes him sit down to the west of the fire, facing the north, and makes him eat the remnants of the sacrificial food, with these (Mantras), 'On thee may wisdom, on thee may offspring' (Taitt. Aranyaka, Andhra redaction, X, 44),--altering (the text of the Mantras).
1.4.10 [*10] Some make (the student) eat 'sprinkled butter.'
1.4.11 (The teacher) looks at (the student) while he is eating, with the two verses, 'At every pursuit we invoke strong (Indra)' (Taitt. Samh. IV, 1, 2, 1), (and), 'Him, Agni, lead to long life and splendour' (Taitt: Samh. II, 3, 10, 3).
1.4.12 Some make (the boy) eat (that food with these two verses).
1.4.13 [*13] After (the boy) has sipped water, (the teacher) causes him to touch (water) and recites over him (the verse), 'A hundred autumns are before us, O gods, before ye have made our bodies decay, before (our) sons have become fathers; do not destroy us before we have reached (our due) age.'
1.5.1 [*1] 'To him who comes (to us), we have come. Drive ye away death! May we walk with him safely; may he walk here in bliss; (may he) walk in bliss until (he returns) to his house'--this (verse the teacher repeats) while (the boy) walks round the fire so as to keep his right side turned towards it.
1.5.2 [*2] (The teacher) then causes him to say, 'I have come hither to be a student. Initiate me! I will be a student, impelled by the god Savitri.'
1.5.3 (The teacher then) asks him:
1.5.4 'What is thy name?'
1.5.5 [*5] He says, 'N.N!'--what his name is.
1.5.6 [*6] (The teacher says), 'Happily, god Savitri, may I attain the goal with this N.N.'--here he pronounces (the student's) two names.
1.5.7 [*7] With (the verse), 'For bliss may the goddesses afford us their protection; may the waters afford drink to us. With bliss and happiness may they overflow us'--both wipe themselves off.
1.5.8 [*8] Then (the teacher) touches with his right hand (the boy's) right shoulder, and with his left (hand) his left (shoulder), and draws (the boy's) right arm towards himself with the Vyahritis, the Savitri verse, and with (the formula), 'By the impulse of the god Savitri, with the arms of the two Asvins, with Pushan's hands I initiate thee, N.N.!'
1.5.9 [*9] He then seizes with his right hand (the boy's) right hand together with the thumb, with (the words), 'Agni has seized thy hand; Soma has seized thy hand; Savitri has seized thy hand; Sarasvati has seized thy hand; Pushan has seized thy hand; Brihaspati has seized thy hand; Mitra has seized thy hand; Varuna has seized thy hand; Tvashtri has seized thy hand; Dhatri has seized thy hand; Vishnu has seized thy hand; Pragapati has seized thy hand.'
1.5.10 [*10] 'May Savitri protect thee. Mitra art thou by rights; Agni is thy teacher. By the impulse of the god Savitri become Brihaspati's pupil. Eat water. Put on fuel. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time'--thus (the teacher) instructs him.
1.5.11 [*11] Then (the teacher) gradually moves his right hand down over (the boy's) right shoulder and touches the place of his heart with (the formulas), 'Thy heart shall dwell in my heart; my mind thou shalt follow with thy mind; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all thy heart; may Brihaspati join thee to me! To me alone thou shalt adhere. In me thy thoughts shall dwell. Upon me thy veneration shall be bent. When I speak, thou shalt be silent.'
1.5.12 With (the words), 'Thou art the knot of all breath; do not loosen thyself'--(he touches) the place of his navel.
1.5.13 [*13] After (the teacher) has recited over him (the formula), 'Bhuh! Bhuvah! Suvah! By offspring may I become rich in offspring! By valiant sons, rich in valiant sons! By splendour, rich in splendour! By wealth, rich in wealth! By wisdom, rich in wisdom! By pupils, rich in holy lustre!' And (again the formulas), 'Bhuh! I place thee in the Rikas, in Agni, on the earth, in voice, in the Brahman, N.N.! Bhuvah! I place thee in the Yagus, in Vayu, in the air, in breath, in the Brahman, N.N.! Suvah! I place thee in the Samans, in Surya, in heaven, in the eye, in the Brahman, N.N.! May I be beloved (?) and dear to thee, N.N.! May I be dear to thee, the fire (?), N.N.! Let us dwell here! Let us dwell in breath and life! Dwell in breath and life, N.N.!'--
1.5.14 [*14] He then seizes with his right hand (the boy's) right hand together with the thumb, with the five sections, 'Agni is long-lived.'
1.5.15 'May (Agni) bestow on thee long life everywhere' (Taitt. Samh. I, 3, 14, 4)--
1.6.1 (This verse the teacher) murmurs in (the boy's) right ear;
1.6.2 (The verse), 'Life-giving, Agni' (Taitt. Samh. I, 3, 14, 4) in his left ear.
1.6.3 [*3] Both times he adds (to the verses quoted in the last Sutras the formula), 'Stand fast in Agni and on the earth, in Vayu and in the air, in Surya and in heaven. The bliss in which Agni, Vayu, the sun, the moon, and the waters go their way, in that bliss go thy way, N.N.! Thou hast become the pupil of breath, N.N.!'
1.6.4 [*4] Approaching his mouth to (the boy's) mouth he murmurs, 'Intelligence may Indra give thee, intelligence the goddess Sarasvati. Intelligence may the two Asvins, wreathed with lotus, bestow on thee.'
1.6.5 [*5] He then gives (the boy) in charge (to the gods and demons, with the formulas), 'To Kashaka (?) I give thee in charge. To Antaka I give thee in charge. To Aghora ("the not frightful one") I give thee in charge. To Disease . . . to Yama . . . to Makha . . . to Vasini ("the ruling goddess") . . . to the earth together with Vaisvanara . . . to the waters . . . to the herbs . . . to the trees . . . to Heaven and Earth . . . to welfare . . . to holy lustre . . . to the Visve devas . . . to all beings . . . to all deities I give thee in charge.'
1.6.6 [*6] He now teaches him the Savitri, if he has (already) been initiated before.
1.6.7 If he has not been initiated (before, he teaches him the Savitri) after three days have elapsed.
1.6.8 (He does so) immediately, says Pushkarasadi.
1.6.9 [*9] Having placed to the west of the fire a bunch of grass with its points directed towards the north, (the teacher) sits down thereon, facing the east, with (the formula), 'A giver of royal power art thou, a teacher's seat. May I not withdraw from thee.'
1.6.10 The boy raises his joined hands towards the sun, embraces (the feet of) his teacher, sits down to the south (of the teacher), addresses (him), 'Recite, sir!' and then says, 'Recite the Savitri, sir!'
1.6.11 Having recited over (the boy the verse), 'We call thee, the lord of the hosts' (Taitt. Samh. II, 3, 14, 3), he then recites (the Savitri) to him, firstly Pada by Pada, then hemistich by hemistich, and then the whole verse (in the following way), 'Bhus! Tat Savitur varenyam (That adorable splendour)-- Bhuvo! Bhargo devasya dhimahi (of the divine Savitri may we obtain)-- Suvar! Dhiyo yo nah prakodayat (who should rouse our prayers).-- Bhur bhuvas! Tat Savitur varenyam bhargo devasya dhimahi-- Suvar! Dhiyo yo nah prakodayat.-- Bhur bhuvah suvas! Tat Savitur . . . prakodayat.'
1.7.1 [*1] He then causes (the student) to put on the fire seven pieces of fresh Palasa wood, with unbroken tops, of one span's length, which have been anointed with ghee.
1.7.2 [*2] One (of these pieces of wood he puts on the fire) with (the Mantra), 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great Gatavedas. As thou art inflamed, Agni, through that piece of wood, thus inflame me through wisdom, insight, offspring, cattle, holy lustre, and through the enjoyment of food. Svaha!'--
1.7.3 (Then he puts on the fire) two (pieces of wood with the same Mantra, using the dual instead of the singular), 'To Agni (I have brought) two pieces of wood;'
1.7.4 (Then) four (pieces of wood, using the plural), 'To Agni (I have brought) pieces of wood.'
1.7.5 [*5] He then sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as above.
1.7.6 [*6] 'Thou hast given thy consent;' 'Thou hast given thy impulse' -- thus he changes the end of each Mantra.
1.7.7 He then worships the (following) deities (with the following Mantras),
1.7.8 [*8] Agni with (the words), 'Agni, lord of the vow, I shall keep the vow;'
1.7.9 Vayu with (the words), 'Vayu, lord of the vow, (&c.);'
1.7.10 Aditya (the sun) with (the words), 'Aditya, lord of the vow, (&c.);'
1.7.11 The lord of the vows with (the words), 'Lord of the vows, ruling over the vows (&c.).'
1.7.12 [*12] He then gives an optional gift to his Guru (i.e. to the teacher).
1.7.13 [*13] (The teacher) makes him rise with (the verse which the student recites), 'Up! with life' (Taitt. Samh. I, 2, 8, 1); he gives him in charge (to the sun) with (the words), 'Sun! This is thy son; I give him in charge to thee;' and he worships the sun with (the Mantra), 'That bright eye created by the gods which rises in the east: may we see it a hundred autumns; may we live a hundred autumns; may we rejoice a hundred autumns; may we be glad a hundred autumns; may we prosper a hundred autumns; may we hear a hundred autumns; may we speak a hundred autumns; may we live undecaying a hundred autumns; and may we long see the sun.'
1.7.14 [*14] 'May Agni further give thee life. May Agni further grant thee bliss. May Indra with the Maruts here give (that) to thee; may the sun with the Vasus give (it) to thee'--with (this verse the teacher) gives him a staff, and then hands over to him a bowl (for collecting alms).
1.7.15 Then he says to him, 'Go out for alms.'
1.7.16 [*16] Let him beg of his mother first;
1.7.17 [*17] Then (let him beg) in other houses where they are kindly disposed towards him.
1.7.18 He brings (the food which he has received) to his Guru (i.e. to the teacher), and announces it to him by saying, '(These are) the alms.'
1.7.19 (The teacher accepts it) with the words, 'Good alms they are.'
1.7.20 [*20] 'May all gods bless thee whose first garment we accept. May after thee, the prosperous one, the well-born, many brothers and friends be born'--with (this verse the teacher) takes (for himself) the former garment (of the student).
1.7.21 When the food (with which the Brahmanas shall be entertained) is ready, (the student) takes some portion of boiled rice, cakes, and flour, mixes (these substances) with clarified butter, and sacrifices with (the formulas), 'To Agni svaha! To Soma svaha! To Agni, the eater of food, svaha! To Agni, the lord of food, svaha! To Pragapati svaha! To the Visve devas svaha! To all deities svaha! To Agni Svishtakrit svaha!'
1.7.22 Thus (let him sacrifice) wherever (oblations of food are prescribed) for which the deities (to whom they shall be offered) are not indicated.
1.7.23 [*23] If the deity is indicated, (let him sacrifice) with (the words), 'To such and such (a deity) svaha!' according to which deity it is.
1.7.24 [*24] Taking (again) some portion of the same kinds of food, he offers it as a Bali on eastward-pointed Darbha grass, with (the words), 'To Vastupati (i.e. Vastoshpati) svaha!'
1.7.25 [*25] After he has served those three kinds of food to the Brahmanas, and has caused them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!'--
1.8.1 [*1] He keeps through three days the (following) vow:
1.8.2 [*2] He eats no pungent or saline food and no vegetables; he sleeps on the ground; he does not drink out of an earthen vessel; he does not give the remnants of his food to a Sudra; he does not eat honey or meat; he does not sleep in the daytime; in the morning and in the evening he brings (to his teacher) the food which he has received as alms and a pot of water; every day (he fetches) a bundle of firewood; in the morning and in the evening, or daily in the evening he puts fuel on (the fire, in the following way):
1.8.3 [*3] Before sprinkling (water) round (the fire), he wipes (with his wet hand) from left to right round (the fire) with the verse, 'As you have loosed, O Vasus, the buffalo-cow' (Taitt. Samh. IV, 7, 15, 7), and sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as above.
1.8.4 [*4] (Then) he puts (four) pieces of wood (on the fire) with the single (Vyahritis) and with (the three Vyahritis) together, and (four other pieces) with (the following four verses), 'This fuel is thine, Agni; thereby thou shalt grow and gain vigour. And may we grow and gain vigour. Svaha! May Indra give me insight; may Sarasvati, the goddess, (give) insight; may both Asvins, wreathed with lotus, bestow insight on me. Svaha! The insight that dwells with the Apsaras, the mind that dwells with the Gandharvas, the divine insight and that which is born from men: may that insight, the fragrant one, rejoice in me! Svaha! May insight, the fragrant one, that assumes all shapes, the gold-coloured, mobile one, come to me. Rich in sap, swelling with milk, may she, insight, the lovely-faced one, rejoice in me! Svaha!'
1.8.5 [*5] Having wiped round (the fire) in the same way, he sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as above.
1.8.6 [*6] He worships the fire with the Mantras, 'What thy splendour is, Agni, may I thereby' (Taitt. Samh. III, 5, 3, 2), and 'On me may insight, on me offspring' (Taitt. Aranyaka X, 44).
1.8.7 [*7] After the lapse of those three days (Sutra 1) he serves in the same way the three kinds of food (stated above) to the Brahmanas, causes them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' and discharges himself of his vow by (repeating) these (Mantras) with (the necessary) alterations, 'Agni, lord of the vow, I have kept the vow' (see above, I, 2, 7, 8).
1.8.8 [*8] He keeps the same observances afterwards (also),
1.8.9 [*9] Dwelling in his teacher's house. He may eat, (however,) pungent and saline food and vegetables.
1.8.10 [*10] He wears a staff, has his hair tied in one knot, and wears a girdle,
1.8.11 Or he may tie the lock on the crown of the head in a knot.
1.8.12 He wears (an upper garment) dyed with red Loth, or the skin (of an antelope, &c.).
1.8.13 He does not have intercourse with women.
1.8.14 [*14] (The studentship lasts) forty-eight years, or twenty-four (years), or twelve (years), or until he has learnt (the Veda).
1.8.15 He should not, however, omit keeping the observances.
1.8.16 [*16] At the beginning and on the completion of the study of a Kanda (of the Black Yagur-veda he sacrifices) with (the verse), 'The lord of the seat, the wonderful one, the friend of Indra, the dear one, I have entreated for the gift of insight. Svaha!' In the second place the Rishi of the Kanda (receives an oblation). (Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varuna;' 'For this I entreat thee;' 'Thou, Agni;' 'Thus thou, Agni;' 'Thou, Agni, art quick;' 'Pragapati!' and, 'What I have done too much in this sacrifice.' Here some add as subordinate oblations the Gaya, Abhyatana, and Rashtrabhrit (oblations) as above.
1.9.1 After he has studied the Veda, the bath (which signifies the end of his studentship, is taken by him).
1.9.2 We shall explain that (bath).
1.9.3 During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon, under (the Nakshatra) Rohini, (or) Mrigasiras, (or) Tishya, (or) Uttara Phalguni, (or) Hasta, (or) Kitra, or the two Visakhas: under these (Nakshatras) he may take the bath.
1.9.4 [*4] He goes to a place near which water is, puts wood on the fire, performs the rites down to the oblations made with the Vyahritis, and puts a piece of Palasa wood on (the fire) with (the verse), 'Let us prepare this song like a chariot, for Gatavedas who deserves it, with our prayer. For his foresight in this assembly is a bliss to us. Agni! Dwelling in thy friendship may we not suffer harm. Svaha!'
1.9.5 Then he sacrifices with the Vyahritis as above,
1.9.6 [*6] (And another oblation with the verse), 'The threefold age of Gamadagni, Kasyapa's threefold age, the threefold age that belongs to the gods: may that threefold age be mine. Svaha!'
1.9.7 (Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varuna,' &c. (see above, I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sutra).
1.9.8 [*8] After he has served food to the Brahmanas, and has caused them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' he discharges himself of his vow by (repeating) these (Mantras), 'Agni, lord of the vow, I have kept the vow.'
1.9.9 Having (thus) discharged himself of his vow, he worships the sun with the two (verses), 'Upwards that (Gatavedas)' (Taitt. Samh. I, 4, 43, 1), and, 'The bright' (ibid.).
1.9.10 [*10] With (the words), '(Loosen) from us thy highest band, Varuna,' he takes off the upper garment which he has worn during his studentship, and puts on another (garment). With (the words), '(Loosen) the lowest (fetter),' (he takes off) the under garment; with (the words), '(Take) away the middle (fetter),' the girdle. With (the words), 'And may we, O Aditya, under thy law (&c.),' (he deposes) his staff. The girdle, the staff, and the black antelope's skin he throws into water, sits down to the west of the fire, facing the east, and touches the razor (with which he is going to be shaven), with (the formula), 'Razor is thy name; the axe is thy father. Adoration to thee! Do no harm to me!'
1.9.11 [*11] Having handed over (that razor) to the barber, he touches the water with which his hair is to be moistened, with (the formula), 'Be blissful, (O waters), when we touch you.' [(The barber) then pours together warm and cold water. Having poured warm (water) into cold (water)--]
1.9.12 [*12] (The barber) moistens the hair near the right ear with (the words), 'May the waters moisten thee for life, for old age and splendour' (Taitt. Samhita I, 2, 1, 1).
1.9.13 [*13] With (the words), 'Herb! protect him' (Taitt. Samh., loc. cit.), he puts an herb with the point upwards into (the hair).
1.9.14 [*14] With (the words), 'Axe! do no harm to him!' (Taitt. Samh., loc. cit.), he touches (that herb) with the razor.
1.9.15 With (the words), 'Heard by the gods, I shave that (hair)' (Taitt. Samh., loc. cit.), he shaves him.
1.9.16 [*16] With (the formula), 'If thou shavest, O shaver, my hair and my beard with the razor, the wounding, the well-shaped, make our face resplendent, but do not take away our life'--(the student who is going to take the bath), looks at the barber.
1.9.17 He has the beard shaven first, then the hair in his arm-pits, then the hair (on his head), then the hair of his body, then (he has) his nails (cut).
1.9.18 A person who is kindly disposed (towards the student), gathers the hair, the beard, the hair of the body, and the nails (that have been cut off), in a lump of bull's dung, and buries (that lump of dung) in a cow-stable, or near an Udumbara tree, or in a clump of Darbha grass, with (the words), 'Thus I hide the sin of N.N., who belongs to the Gotra N.N.'
1.9.19 Having rubbed himself with powder such as is used in bathing, he cleanses his teeth with a stick of Udumbara wood--
1.10.1 With (the formula), 'Stand in your places for the sake of the enjoyment of food. Stand in your places for the sake of long life. Stand in your places for the sake of holy lustre. May I be blessed with long life, an enjoyer of food, adorned with holy lustre.'
1.10.2 Then (the teacher) makes him wash himself with lukewarm water, with the three verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome' (Taitt. Samh. IV, I, 5, 1), with the four verses, 'The gold-coloured, clean, purifying (waters)' (Taitt. Samh. V, 6, 1), and with the Anuvaka, 'The purifier, the heavenly one' (Taitt. Brahmana I, 4, 8).
1.10.3 [*3] Or (instead of performing these rites in the neighbourhood of water) they make an enclosure in a cow-stable and cover it (from all sides); that (the student) enters before sunrise, and in that (enclosure) the whole (ceremony) is performed. 'On that day the sun does not shine upon him,' some say. 'For he who shines (i.e. the sun), shines by the splendour of those who have taken the bath. Therefore the face of a Snataka is, as it were, resplendent (?).'
1.10.4 [*4] (His friends or relations) bring him all sorts of perfumes, or ground sandal wood; he besprinkles that (with water), and worships the gods by raising his joined hands towards the east, with (the formulas), 'Adoration to Graha (the taker) and to Abhigraha (the seizer)! Adoration to Saka and Gangabha! Adoration to those deities who are seizers!' (Then) he anoints himself with (that salve of sandal wood) with (the verse), 'The scent that dwells with the Apsaras, and the splendour that dwells with the Gandharvas, divine and human scent: may that here enter upon me!'
1.10.5 They bring him a pair of (new) garments that have not yet been washed. He besprinkles them (with water) and puts on the under garment with (the formula), 'Thou art Soma's body; protect my body! Thou who art my own body, enter upon me; thou who art a blissful body, enter upon me.' Then he touches water, (puts on) the upper garment with the same (Mantra), and sits down to the west of the fire, facing the east.
1.10.6 [*6] They bring him two ear-rings and a perforated pellet of sandal wood or of Badari wood, overlaid with gold (at its aperture); these two things he ties to a Darbha blade, holds them over the fire, and pours over them (into the fire) oblations (of ghee) with (the Mantras), 'May this gold which brings long life and splendour and increase of wealth, and which gets through (all adversities), enter upon me for the sake of long life, of splendour, and of victory. Svaha! (This gold) brings high gain, superiority in battles, superiority in assemblies; it conquers treasures. All perfections unitedly dwell together in this gold. Svaha! I have obtained an auspicious name like (the name) of a father of gold. Thus may (the gold) make me shine with golden lustre; (may it make me) beloved among many people; may it make me full of holy lustre. Svaha! Make me beloved among the gods; make me beloved with Brahman (i.e. among the Brahmanas), beloved among Vaisyas and Sudras; make me beloved among the kings (i.e. among the Kshatriyas). Svaha! This herb is protecting, overcoming, and powerful. May it make me shine with golden lustre; (may it make me) beloved among many people; may it make me full of holy lustre. Svaha!'
1.10.7 Having thrice washed (the two ear-rings) in a vessel of water with the same five (Mantras), without the word Svaha, (moving them round in the water) from left to right--
1.11.1 He puts on the two ear-rings, the right one to his right ear, the left one to his left ear, with (the verse which he repeats for each of the two earrings), 'Virag and Svarag, and the aiding powers that dwell in our house, the prosperity that dwells in the face of royalty: therewith unite me.'
1.11.2 [*2] With (the Mantra), 'With the seasons and the combinations of seasons, for the sake of long life, of splendour, with the sap that dwells in the year: therewith we make them touch the jaws'--he clasps the two ear-rings.
1.11.3 [*3] With (the Mantra), 'This herb is protecting, overcoming, and powerful. May it make me shine with golden lustre; (may it make me) beloved among many people; may it make me full of holy lustre. Thou art not a bond'--he ties the pellet (of wood, mentioned above, Section 10, Sutra 6) to his neck.
1.11.4 [*4] He puts on a wreath with the two (verses), 'Beautiful one, elevate thyself to beauty, beautifying my face. Beautify my face and make my fortune increase'--(and), '(The wreath) which Gamadagni has brought to Sraddha to please her, that I put on (my head) together with fortune and splendour.'
1.11.5 [*5] 'The salve coming from the Trikakud (mountain), born on the Himavat, therewith I anoint you (i.e. the eyes), and with fortune and splendour. (I put?) into myself the demon of the mountain (?)'--with (this verse) he anoints himself with Traikakuda salve, (or) if he cannot get that, with some other (salve).
1.11.6 With (the verse), 'My mind that has fled away' (Taitt. Samhita VI, 6, 7, 2) he looks into a mirror.
1.11.7 [*7] With (the formula), 'On the impulse of the god,' &c., he takes a staff of reed (which somebody hands him), and with (the formula), 'Thou art the thunderbolt of Indra. O Asvins, protect me!'--he thrice wipes it off, upwards from below.
1.11.8 With (the formula), 'Speed! Make speed away from us those who hate us, robbers, creeping things, beasts of prey, Rakshas, Pisakas. Protect us, O staff, from danger that comes from men; protect us from every danger; from all sides destroy the robbers'--(and with the verse), 'Not naked (i.e. covered with bark) thou art born on all trees, a destroyer of foes. Destroy all hosts of enemies from every side like Maghavan (Indra)'--he swings (the staff) three times from left to right over his head.
1.11.9 [*9] With (the formula), 'The divine standing-places are you. Do not pinch me'--he steps into the shoes.
1.11.10 [*10] With (the formula), 'Pragapati's shelter art thou, the Brahman's covering'--he takes the parasol.
1.11.11 [*11] With the verse, 'My staff which fell down in the open air to the ground, that I take up again for the sake of long life, of holiness, of holy lustre'--he takes up his staff, if it has fallen from his hand.
1.12.1 They bring him a chariot, (or) a horse, or an elephant.
1.12.2 [*2] 'Thou art the (Saman called) Rathantara; thou art the Vamadevya; thou art the Brihat;' the (verse), 'The two Ankas, the two Nyankas' (Taitt. Samhita I, 7, 7, 2); (the verse), 'May this your chariot, O Asvins, not suffer damage, neither in pain nor in joy. May it make its way without damage, dispersing those who infest us;' (and the formula), 'Here is holding, here is keeping asunder; here is enjoyment, here may it enjoy itself:' with (these texts) he ascends the chariot, if he enters (the village) on a chariot.
1.12.3 [*3] 'A horse art thou, a steed art thou'--with these eleven 'horses' names' (Taitt. Samh. VII, 1, 12) (he mounts) the horse, if (he intends to enter the village) on horseback.
1.12.4 [*4] With (the formula), 'With Indra's thunderbolt I bestride thee; carry (me); carry the time; carry me forward to bliss. An elephant art thou. The elephant's glory art thou. The elephant's splendour art thou. May I become endowed with the elephant's glory, with the elephant's splendour'--(he mounts) the elephant, if (he intends to proceed to the village) on it.
1.12.5 [*5] He goes to a place where they will do honour to him.
1.12.6 With (the verse), 'May the quarters (of the horizon) stream together with me; may all delight assemble (here). May all wishes that are dear to us, come near unto us; may (our) dear (wishes) stream towards us'--he worships the quarters of the horizon.
1.12.7 While approaching the person who is going to do honour to him, he looks at him with (the words), 'Glory art thou; may I become glory with thee.'
1.12.8 Then (the host who is going to offer the Argha reception to the Snataka), having prepared the dwelling-place (for his reception), says to him, 'The Argha (will be offered)!'
1.12.9 (The guest) replies, 'Do so!'
1.12.10 [*10] They prepare for him (the Madhuparka or 'honey mixture') consisting of three or of five substances.
1.12.11 The three substances are, curds, honey, and ghee.
1.12.12 The five substances are, curds, honey, ghee, water, and ground grains.
1.12.13 Having poured curds into a brass vessel, he pours honey into it, (and then the other substances stated above).
1.12.14 [*14] Having poured (those substances) into a smaller vessel, and having covered it with a larger (cover than the vessel is), (the host) makes (the guest) accept (the following things) separately, one after the other, viz. a bunch of grass (to sit down on), water for washing the feet, the Argha water, water for sipping, and the honey-mixture (Madhuparka).
1.12.15 [*15] Going after (the single objects which are brought to the guest, the host) in a faultless, not faltering (?) voice, announces (each of those objects to the guest).
1.12.16 The bunch of grass (he announces by three times saying), 'The bunch of grass!'
1.12.17 [*17] (The guest) sits down thereon facing the east, with (the formula), 'A giver of royal power art thou, a teacher's seat; may I not withdraw from thee.'
1.12.18 (The host) then utters to him the announcement, 'The water for washing the feet!'
1.12.19 [*19] With that (water) a Sudra or a Sudra woman washes his feet; the left foot first for a Brahmana, the right for a person of the two other castes.
1.13.1 [*1] With (the formula), 'The milk of Virag art thou. May the milk of Padya Virag (dwell) in me'--(the guest) touches the hands of the person that washes his feet, and then he touches himself with (the formula), 'May in me dwell brilliancy, energy, strength, life, renown, splendour, glory, power!'
1.13.2 (The host) then makes to him the announcement, 'The Argha water!'
1.13.3 [*3] (The guest) accepts it with (the formula), 'Thou camest to me with glory. Unite me with brilliancy, splendour, and milk. Make me beloved by all creatures, the lord of cattle.'
1.13.4 [*4] 'To the ocean I send you, the imperishable (waters); go back to your source. May I not suffer loss in my offspring. May my sap not be shed'--this (verse the guest) recites over the remainder (of the Argha water), when it is poured out (by the person who had offered it to him).
1.13.5 Then he utters to him the announcement, 'The water for sipping!'
1.13.6 [*6] With (the formula), 'Thou art the first layer for Ambrosia,' he sips water.
1.13.7 Then he utters to him the announcement, 'The honey-mixture!'
1.13.8 [*8] He accepts that with both hands with the Savitra (formula), and places it on the ground with (the formula), 'I place thee on the navel of the earth in the abode of Ida.' He mixes (the different substances) three times from left to right with his thumb and his fourth finger, with (the formula), 'What is the honied, highest form of honey which consists in the enjoyment of food, by that honied, highest form of honey may I become highest, honied, and an enjoyer of food.' He partakes of it three times with (the formula), 'I eat thee for the sake of brilliancy, of luck, of glory, of power, and of the enjoyment of food,' and gives the remainder to a person who is kindly disposed towards him.
1.13.9 [*9] Or he may eat the whole (Madhuparka). Then he sips water with (the formula), 'Thou art the covering of Ambrosia.'
1.13.10 [*10] Then he utters to him the announcement, 'The cow!'
1.13.11 That (cow) is either killed or let loose.
1.13.12 If he chooses to let it loose, (he murmurs), 'This cow will become a milch cow. The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the sister of the Adityas, the navel of immortality. To the people who understand me, I say, "Do not kill the guiltless cow, which is Aditi." 'Let it drink water! Let it eat grass'-- (And) gives order (to the people), 'Om! Let it loose.'
1.13.13 [*13] If it shall be killed, (he says), 'A cow art thou; sin is driven away from thee. Drive away my sin and the sin of N.N.! Kill ye him whoever hates me. He is killed whosoever hates me. Make (the cow) ready!'
1.13.14 [*14] If (the cow) is let loose, a meal is prepared with other meat, and he announces it (to the guest) in the words, 'It is ready!'
1.13.15 He replies, 'It is well prepared; it is the Virag; it is food. May it not fail! May I obtain it! May it give me strength! It is well prepared!'--and adds, 'Give food to the Brahmanas!'
1.13.16 [*16] After those (Brahmanas) have eaten, (the host) orders blameless (?) food to be brought to him (i.e. to the guest).
1.13.17 He accepts that with (the formula), 'May the heaven give it to thee; may the earth accept it. May the earth give it to thee; may breath accept it. May breath eat thee; may breath drink thee.'
1.13.18 With (the verse), 'May Indra and Agni bestow vigour on me' (Taitt. Samh. III, 3, 3, 3) he eats as much as he likes, and gives the remainder to a person who is kindly disposed towards him.
1.13.19 If he desires that somebody may not be estranged from him, he should sip water with (the Mantra), 'Whereon the past and the future and all worlds rest, therewith I take hold of thee; I (take. hold) of thee; through the Brahman I take hold of thee for myself, N.N.!'--
1.14.1 And should, after that person has eaten, seize his right hand,
1.14.2 [*2] If he wishes that one of his companions, or a pupil, or a servant should faithfully remain with him and not go away, he should bathe in the morning, should put on clean garments, should show patience (with that servant, &c.) during the day, should speak (only) with Brahmanas, and by night he should go to the dwelling-place of that person, should make water into a horn of a living animal, and should three times walk round his dwelling-place, sprinkling (his urine) round it, with (the Mantra), 'From the mountain (I sever?) thee, from thy brother, from thy sister, from all thy relations. parishidah kleshyati (i.e. kvaishyasi?) sasvat parikupilena samkramenavikkhida, ulena parimidho'si parimidho'sy ulena.'
1.14.3 He puts down the horn of the living animal in a place which is generally accessible.
1.14.4 [*4] One whose companions, pupils, or servants use to run away, should rebuke them with (the Mantra), 'May he who calls hither (?), call you hither! He who brings back, has brought you back (?). May the rebuke of Indra always rebuke you. If you, who worship your own deceit, despise me (?), . . . . may Indra bind you with his bond, and may he drive you back again to me.'
1.14.5 Then he enters his house, puts a piece of Sidhraka wood on (the fire), and sacrifices with the 'on-drawing verse,' 'Back-bringer, bring them back' (Taitt. Samh. III, 3, 10, 1).
1.14.6 Now (we shall explain) how one should guard his wife.
1.14.7 [*7] One whose wife has a paramour, should grind big centipedes (?) to powder, and should insert (that powder), while his wife is sleeping, into her secret parts, with the Mantra, 'Indra. . . . from other men than me.'
1.14.8 Now (follows the sacrifice for procuring) prosperity in trade.
1.14.9 He cuts off (some portion) from (every) article of trade and sacrifices it--
1.15.1 [*1] With (the verse), 'If we trade, O gods, trying by our wealth to acquire (new) wealth, O gods, may Soma thereon bestow splendour, Agni, Indra, Brihaspati, and Isana. Svaha!'
1.15.2 Now (follows) the way for appeasing anger.
1.15.3 [*3] He addresses the angry person with (the verses), 'The power of wrath that dwells here on thy forehead, destroying thy enemy (?), may the chaste, wise gods take that away. 'If thou shootest, as it were, the thought dwelling in thy face, upwards to thy forehead, I loosen the anger of thy heart like the bow-string of an archer. Day, heaven, and earth: we appease thy anger, as the womb of a she-mule (cannot conceive).'
1.15.4 Now (follows) the way for obtaining the victory in disputes.
1.15.5 [*5] He puts wood on the fire at night-time in an inner apartment, performs the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations, and sacrifices small grains mixed with A ya, with (the verse), 'Tongueless one, thou who art without a tongue! I drive thee away through my sacrifice, so that I may gain the victory in the dispute, and that N.N. may be defeated by me. Svaha!'
1.15.6 [*6] Then in the presence (of his adversary), turned towards him, he murmurs (the verses), 'I take away the speech from thy mouth, (the speech) that dwells in thy mind, (the speech) from thy heart. Out of every limb I take thy speech. Wheresoever thy speech dwells, thence I take it away. 'Rudra with the dark hair-lock! Hero! At every contest strike down this my adversary, as a tree (is struck down) by a thunderbolt. Be defeated, be conquered, when thou speakest. Sink down under the earth, when thou speakest, struck down by me irresistibly (?) with the hammer of . . . (?). That is true what I speak. Fall down, inferior to me, N.N.!'
1.15.7  He touches the assembly-hall (in which the contest is going on), and murmurs, 'The golden-armed, blessed (goddess), whose eyes are not faint, who is decked with ornaments, seated in the midst of the gods, has spoken for my good. Svaha!'
1.15.8  'For me have the high ones and the low ones, for me has this wide earth, for me have Agni and Indra accomplished my divine aim'--with (this verse) he looks at the assembly, and murmurs (it) turned towards (the assembly).
1.16.1 When he has first seen the new moon, he sips water, and holding (a pot of) water (in his hands) he worships (the moon) with the four (verses), 'Increase' (Taitt. Samh. I, 4, 32), 'May thy milk' (ibid. IV, 2, 7, 4), 'New and new again (the moon) becomes, being born' (ibid. II, 4, 14, 1), 'That Soma which the Adityas make swell' (ibid. II, 4, 14, 1).
1.16.2 [*2] When he has yawned, he murmurs, '(May) will and insight (dwell) in me.'
1.16.3 [*3] If the skirt (of his garment) is blown upon him (by the wind), he murmurs, 'A skirt art thou. Thou art not a thunderbolt. Adoration be to thee. Do no haft to me.'
1.16.4 He should tear off a thread (from that skirt) and should blow it away with his mouth.
1.16.5 [*5] If a bird has befouled him with its excrements, he murmurs, 'The birds that timidly fly together with the destroyers, shall pour out on me happy, blissful splendour and vigour.' Then let him wipe off that (dirt) with something else than his hand, and let him wash himself with water.
1.16.6 [*6] 'From the sky, from the wide air a drop of water has fallen down on me, bringing luck. With my senses, with my mind I have united myself, protected by the prayer that is brought forth by the righteous ones'--this (verse) he should murmur, if a drop of water unexpectedly falls down on him.
1.16.7 [*7] 'If a fruit has fallen down from the top of a tree, or from the air, it is Vayu (who has made it fall). Where it has touched our bodies or the garment, (there) may the waters drive away destruction'--this (verse) he should murmur, if a fruit unexpectedly falls down on him.
1.16.8 [*8] 'Adoration to him who dwells at the cross-roads, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells at the cross-roads!'--this (formula) he murmurs when he comes to a cross-road;
1.16.9 'Adoration to him who dwells among cattle, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells among cattle!'--thus at a dung-heap;
1.16.10 'Adoration to him who dwells among the serpents, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells among the serpents!'--thus at a place that is frequented by serpents.
1.16.11 'Adoration to him who dwells in the air, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells in the air!'--this (formula) let him murmur, if overtaken by a tornado.
1.16.12 'Adoration to him who dwells in the waters, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells in the waters!'--this (formula) he murmurs when plunging into a river which is full of water.
1.16.13 'Adoration to him who dwells there, whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells there!'--this (formula) he murmurs when approaching a beautiful place, a sacrificial site, or a big tree.
1.16.14 [*14] If the sun rises whilst he is sleeping, he shall fast that day and shall stand silent during that day;
1.16.15 The same during the night, if the sun sets whilst he sleeps.
1.16.16 [*16] Let him not touch a sacrificial post. By touching it, he would bring upon himself (the guilt of) whatever faults have been committed at that sacrifice. If he touches one (sacrificial post), he should say, 'This is thy wind;' if two (posts), 'These are thy two winds;' if many (posts), 'These are thy winds.'
1.16.17 [*17] 'The voices that are heard after us (?) and around us, the praise that is heard, and the voices of the birds, the deer's running (?) athwart: that we fear (?) from our enemies'--this (verse) he murmurs when setting out on a road.
1.16.18 [*18] 'Like an Udgatri, O bird, thou singest the Saman; like a Brahman's son thou recitest thy hymn, when the Soma is pressed. 'A blessing on us, O bird; bring us luck and be kind towards us!'--(This Mantra) he murmurs against an inauspicious bird;
1.16.19 [*19] 'If thou raisest thy divine voice, entering upon living beings, drive away our enemies by thy voice. O death, lead them to death!'--(thus) against a solitary jackal.
1.16.20 Then he throws before the (jackal, as it were), a fire-brand that burns at both ends, towards that region (in which the jackal's voice is heard), with (the words), 'Fire! Speak to the fire! Death! Speak to the death!' Then he touches water,
1.16.21 And worships (the jackal) with the Anuvaka, 'Thou art mighty, thou carriest away' (Taitt. Samhita I, 3, 3).
1.17.1 A she-wolf (he addresses) with (the verse), 'Whether incited by others or whether on its own accord the Bhayedaka (? Bhayodaka, var. lect.) utters this cry, may Indra and Agni, united with Brahman, render it blissful to us in our house.'
1.17.2 [*2] A bird (he addresses) with (the verse), 'Thou fliest, stretching out thy legs; the left eye . . .; may nothing here suffer harm (through thee);'
1.17.3 An owl (pingala) with (the verse), 'The bird with the golden wings flies to the abode of the gods. Flying round the village from left to right portend us luck by thy cry, O owl!'
1.17.4 [*4] 'May my faculties return into me; may life return, prosperity return; may the divine power return into me; may my goods return to me. And may these fires that are stationed on the (altars called) Dhishnyas, be in good order here, each in its right place. Svaha! My self has returned, life has returned to me; breath has returned, design has returned to me. (Agni) Vaisvanara, grown strong with his rays, may he dwell in my mind, the standard of immortality. Svaha! The food which is eaten in the evening, that does not satiate in the morning him whom hunger assails. May all that (which we have seen in our dreams), do no harm to us, for it has not been seen by day. To Day svaha!'--with these (verses) he sacrifices sesamum seeds mixed with Agya, if he has seen a bad dream.
1.17.5 [*5] Now the following expiations for portents are prescribed. A dove sits down on the hearth, or the bees make honey in his house, or a cow (that is not a calf) sucks another cow, or a post puts forth shoots, or an anthill has arisen (in his house): cases like these (require the following expiation):
1.17.6 [*6] He should bathe in the morning, should put on clean garments, should show patience (with everybody) during the day, and should speak (only) with Brahmanas. Having put wood on the fire in an inner apartment, and having performed the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations, he sacrifices with (the verses), 'This, O Varuna,' &c. (see above I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sutra). Then he serves food to the Brahmanas and causes them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!
1.18.1 [*1] 'May Indra and Agni make you go. May the two Asvins protect you. Brihaspati is your herdsman. May Pushan drive you back again' -- this (verse) he recites over the cows when they go away (to their pasture-grounds), and (the verse), 'May Pushan go after our cows' (Taitt. Samh. IV, 1, 11, 2).
1.18.2 With (the verse), 'These cows that have come hither, free from disease and prolific, may they swim (full of wealth) like rivers; may they pour out (wealth), as (rivers discharge their floods) into the ocean'--he looks at the cows, when they are coming back.
1.18.3 [*3] With (the formula), 'You are a stand at rest; may I (?) become your stand at rest. You are immovable. Do not move from me. May I not move from you, the blessed ones'--(he looks at them) when they are standing still.
1.18.4 With (the formula), 'I see you full of sap. Full of sap you shall see me'--(he looks at them) when they are gone into the stable, and with (the formula), 'May I be prosperous through your thousandfold prospering.'
1.18.5 [*5] Then having put wood on the fire amid the cows, and having performed the rites down to the Vyahriti (oblations), he makes oblations of milk with (the verses), 'Blaze brightly, O Gatavedas, driving destruction away from me. Bring me cattle and maintenance from all quarters of the heaven. Svaha! May Gatavedas do no harm to us, to cows and horses, to men and to all that moves. Come hither, Agni, fearlessly; make me attain to welfare! Svaha!' -- And with (the two verses), 'This is the influx of the waters,' and 'Adoration to thee, the rapid one, the shining one' (Taitt. Samh. IV, 6, 1, 3).
1.18.6 Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varuna' (&c.; see I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sutra).
1.19.1 After he has returned from the teacher's house, he should support his father and mother.
1.19.2 [*2] With their permission he should take a wife belonging to the same caste and country, a 'naked' girl, a virgin who should belong to a different Gotra (from her husband's).
1.19.3 [*3] Whatever he intends to do (for instance, taking a wife), he should do on an auspicious day only, during one of the following five spaces of time, viz. in the morning, the forenoon, at midday, in the afternoon, or in the evening.
1.19.4 [*4] Having put wood on the fire, and having performed (the preparatory rites) down to the laying of (three) branches round (the fire, the bridegroom) looks at the bride who is led to him, with (the verse), 'Auspicious ornaments does this woman wear. Come up to her and behold her. Having brought lack to her, go away back to your houses.'
1.19.5 To the south of the bridegroom the bride sits down.
1.19.6 [*6] After she has sipped water, she touches him, and he sprinkles (water) round (the fire) as above.
1.19.7 [*7] After he has performed the rites down to the oblations made with the Vyahritis, he sacrifices with (the following Mantras), 'May Agni come hither, the first of gods. May he release the offspring of this wife from the fetter of death. That may this king Varuna grant, that this wife may not weep over distress (falling to her lot) through her sons. Svaha! May Agni Garhapatya protect this woman. May he lead her offspring to old age. With fertile womb may she be the mother of living children. May she experience delight in her sons. Svaha! May no noise that comes from thee, arise in the house by night. May the (she-goblins called) the weeping ones take their abode in another (woman) than thee. Mayst thou not be beaten at thy breast by (the she-goblin) Vikesi ("the rough-haired one"). May thy husband live, and mayst thou shine in thy husband's world, beholding thy genial offspring! Svaha! May Heaven protect thy back, Vayu thy thighs, and the two Asvins thy breast. May Savitri protect thy suckling sons. Until the garment is put on (thy sons?), may Brihaspati guard (them?), and the Visve devas afterwards. Svaha! Childlessness, the death of sons, evil, and distress, I take (from thee), as a wreath (is taken) from the head, and (like a wreath) I put all evil on (the head of) our foes. Svaha! With this well-disposed prayer which the gods have created, I kill the Pisakas that dwell in thy womb. The flesh-devouring death-bringers I cast down. May thy sons live to old age. Svaha!'
1.19.8 After he has sacrificed with (the verses), 'This, O Varuna,' 'For this I entreat thee,' 'Thou Agni,' Thus thou, Agni,' 'Thou, Agni, art quick,' 'Pragapati'--he makes her tread on a stone, with (the verse), 'Tread on this stone; like a stone be firm. Destroy those who seek to do thee harm; overcome thy enemies.'
1.19.9 To the west of the fire he strews two layers of northward-pointed Darbha grass, the one more to the west, the other more to the east. On these both (the bridegroom and the bride) station themselves, the one more to the west, the other more to the east.
1.19.8 See above, I, 1, 3, 5; I, 1, 4, 1.
1.20.1 [*1] Facing the east, while she faces the west, or facing the west, while she faces the east, he should seize her hand. If he desires to generate male children, let him seize her thumb; if he desires (to generate) female children, her other fingers; if he desires (to generate) both (male and female children), let him seize the thumb together with the other fingers, (so as to seize the hand) up to the hairs (on the hair-side of the hand). (He should do so with the two Mantras), 'Sarasvati! Promote this (our undertaking), O gracious one, rich in studs, thou whom we sing first of all that is. I seize thy hand that we may be blessed with offspring, that thou mayst live to old age with me, thy husband. Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitri, Purandhi, the gods have given thee to me that we may rule our house.'
1.20.2 [*2] He makes her turn round, from left to right, so that she faces the west, and recites over her (the following texts), 'With no evil eye, not bringing death to thy husband, bring luck to the cattle, be full of joy and vigour. Give birth to living children, give birth to heroes, be friendly. Bring us luck, to men and animals. Thus, Pushan, lead her to us, the highly blessed one, into whom men pour forth their sperm, ya na uru usati visrayatai (read, visrayatai), yasyam usantah praharema sepam. Soma has acquired thee first (as his wife); after him the Gandharva has acquired thee. Thy third husband is Agni; the fourth am I, thy human husband. Soma has given her to the Gandharva; the Gandharva has given her to Agni. Agni gives me cattle and children, and thee besides. This am I, that art thou; the heaven I, the earth thou; the Saman I, the Rik thou. Come! Let us join together. Let us unite our sperm that we may generate a male child, a son, for the sake of the increase of wealth, of blessed offspring, of strength. Bountiful Indra, bless this woman with sons and with a happy lot. Give her ten sons; let her husband be the eleventh.'
1.20.3 [*3] After he has made her sit down in her proper place (see Sutra 5 of the preceding section), and has sprinkled Agya into her joined hands, he twice pours fried grain into them, with (the verse), 'This grain I pour (into thy hands): may it bring prosperity to me, and may it unite thee (with me). May this Agni grant us that.'
1.20.4 After he has sprinkled (Agya) over (the grain in her hands), he sacrifices (the grain) with her joined hands (which he seizes), with (the verse), 'This woman, strewing grain into the fire, prays thus, "May my husband live long; may my relations be prosperous. Svaha!"'
1.20.5 [*5] Having made her rise with (the verse which she recites), 'Up! with life' (Taitt. Samh. I, 2, 8, 1), and having circumambulated the fire (with her) so that their right sides are turned towards it, with (the verse), 'May we find our way with thee through all hostile powers, as through streams of water'--he pours fried grain (into her hands, and sacrifices them), as before.
1.20.6 Having circumambulated (the fire) a second time, he pours fried grain (into her hands, and sacrifices them), as before.
1.20.7 Having circumambulated (the fire) a third time, he sacrifices to (Agni) Svishtakrit.
1.20.8 [*8] Here some add as subordinate oblations the Gaya, Abhyatana, and Rashtrabhrit (oblations) as above.
1.20.9 [*9] To the west of the fire he makes her step forward in an easterly or a northerly direction the (seven) 'steps of Vishnu.'
1.20.10 He says to her, 'Step forward with the right (foot) and follow with the left. Do not put the left (foot) before the right.'
1.21.1 (He makes her step forward, and goes with her himself), with (the Mantras), 'One (step) for sap, may Vishnu go after thee; two (steps) for juice, may Vishnu go after thee; three (steps) for vows, may Vishnu go after thee; four (steps) for comfort, may Vishnu go after thee; five (steps) for cattle, may Vishnu go after thee; six (steps) for the prospering of wealth, may Vishnu go after thee; seven (steps) for the sevenfold Hotriship, may Vishnu go after thee.'
1.21.2 After the seventh step he makes her abide (in that position) and murmurs, 'With seven steps we have become friends. May I attain to friendship with thee. May I not be separated from thy friendship. Mayst thou not be separated from my friendship.'
1.21.3 [*3] He then puts his right foot on her right foot, moves his right hand down gradually over her right shoulder, and touches the place of her heart as above,
1.21.4 [*4] And the place of her navel with (the formula), 'Thou art the knot of all breath; do not loosen thyself.'
1.21.5 [*5] After he has made her sit down to the west of the fire, so that she faces the east, he stands to the east (of his bride), facing the west, and besprinkles her with water, with the three verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome' (Taitt. Samh. IV, I, 5, 1), with the four verses, 'The gold-coloured, clean, purifying waters' (V, 6, 1), and with the Anuvaka, 'The purifier, the heavenly one' (Taitt. Brahmana I, 4, 8).
1.21.6 [*6] Now they pour seeds (of rice, &c.) on (the heads of the bridegroom and bride).
1.22.1 Then they let her depart (in a vehicle from her father's house), or they let her be taken away.
1.22.2 Having put (the fire into a vessel) they carry that (nuptial) fire behind (the newly-married couple).
1.22.3 It should be kept constantly.
1.22.4 [*4] If it goes out, (a new fire) should be kindled by attrition, or it should be fetched from the house of a Srotriya.
1.22.5 Besides, if (the fire) goes out, the wife or the husband should fast.
1.22.6 When (the bridegroom with his bride) has come to his house, he says to her, 'Cross (the threshold) with thy right foot first; do not stand on the threshold.'
1.22.7 In the hall, in its easterly part, he puts down the fire and puts wood on it.
1.22.8 To the west of the fire he spreads out a red bull's skin with the neck to the east, with the hair outside.
1.22.9 [*9] On that (skin) they both sit down facing the east or the north, so that the wife sits behind her husband, with (the verse), 'Here may the cows sit down, here the horses, here the men. Here may also Pushan with a thousand (sacrificial) gifts sit down.'
1.22.10 They sit silently until the stars appear.
1.22.11 When the stars have appeared, he goes forth from the house (with his wife) in an easterly or northerly direction, and worships the quarters (of the horizon) with (the hemistich), 'Ye goddesses, ye six wide ones' (Taitt. Samh. IV, 7, 14, 2).
1.22.12 [*12] (He worships) the stars with (the Pada), 'May we not be deprived of our offspring;'
1.22.13 The moon with (the Pada), 'May we not get into the power of him who hates us, O king Soma!
1.22.14 He worships the seven Rishis (ursa major) with (the verse), 'The seven Rishis who have led to firmness she, Arundhati, who stands first among the six Krittikas (pleiads):--may she, the eighth one, who leads the conjunction of the (moon with the) six Krittikas, the first (among conjunctions) shine upon us!' Then he worships the polar star with (the formula), 'Firm dwelling, firm origin. The firm one art thou, standing on the side of firmness. Thou art the pillar of the stars; thus protect me against my adversary. Adoration be to the Brahman, to the firm, immovable one! Adoration be to the Brahman's son, Pragapati! Adoration to the Brahman's children, to the thirty-three gods! Adoration to the Brahman's children and grandchildren, to the Angiras! He who knows thee (the polar star) as the firm, immovable Brahman with its children and with its grandchildren, with such a man children and grandchildren will firmly dwell, servants and pupils, garments and woollen blankets, bronze and gold, wives and kings, food, safety, long life, glory, renown, splendour, strength, holy lustre, and the enjoyment of food. May all these things firmly and immovably dwell with me!'
1.23.1 (Then follow the Mantras), 'I know thee as the firm Brahman. May I become firm in this world and in this country. I know thee as the immovable Brahman. May I not be moved away from this world and from this country. May he who hates me, my rival, be moved away from this world and from this country. I know thee as the unshaken Brahman. May I not be shaken off from this world and from this country. May he who hates me, my rival, be shaken off from this world and from this country. I know thee as the unfailing Brahman. May I not fall from this world and from this country. May he who hates me, my rival, fall from this world and from this country. I know thee as the nave of the universe. May I become the nave of this country. I know thee as the centre of the universe. May I become the centre of this country. I know thee as the string that holds the universe. May I become the string that holds this country. I know thee as the pillar of the universe. May I become the pillar of this country. I know thee as the navel of the universe. May I become the navel of this country. As the navel is the centre of the Pranas, thus I am the navel. May hundred-and-onefold evil befall him who hates us and whom we hate; may more than hundred-and-onefold merit fall to my lot!'
1.23.2 Having spoken there with a person that he likes, and having returned to the house, he causes her to sacrifice a mess of cooked food.
1.23.3 The wife husks (the rice grains of which that Sthalipaka is prepared).
1.23.4 She cooks (that Sthalipaka), sprinkles (Agya) on it, takes it from the fire, sacrifices to Agni, and then sacrifices to Agni Svishtakrit.
1.23.5 [*5] With (the remains of) that (Sthalipaka) he entertains a learned Brahmana whom he reveres.
1.23.6 To that (Brahmana) he makes a present of a bull.
1.23.7 From that time he constantly sacrifices (yagate) on the days of the full and of the new moon a mess of cooked food sacred to Agni.
1.23.8 In the evening and in the morning he constantly sacrifices (guhoti) with his hand (and not with the Darvi) the two following oblations of rice or of barley: 'To Agni Svaha! To Pragapati Svaha!'
1.23.9 Some (teachers) state that in the morning the former (of these oblations) should be directed to Surya.
1.23.10 Through a period of three nights they should eat no saline food, should sleep on the ground, wear ornaments, and should be chaste.
1.23.11 [*11] In the fourth night, towards morning, he puts wood on the fire, performs the (regular) ceremonies down to the (regular) expiatory oblations, and sacrifices nine expiatory oblations (with the following Mantras):
1.24.1 'Agni! Expiation! Thou art expiation. I, the Brahmana, entreat thee, desirous of protection. What is terrible in her, drive that away from here. Svaha! Vayu! Expiation! Thou art expiation. I, the Brahmana, entreat thee, desirous of protection. What is blameful in her, drive that away from here. Svaha! Sun! Expiation! Thou art expiation. I, the Brahmana, entreat thee, desirous of protection. What dwells in her that is death-bringing to her husband, drive that away from here. Svaha! Sun! Expiation! &c. Vayu! Expiation! &c. Agni! Expiation! &c. Agni! Expiation! &c. Vayu! Expiation! &c. Sun! Expiation! &c.'
1.24.2 Having sacrificed (these oblations), he then pours the remainder as an oblation on her head, with (the formulas), 'Bhuh! I sacrifice fortune over thee. Svaha! Bhuvah! I sacrifice glory over thee. Svaha! Suvah! I sacrifice beauty over thee. Svaha! Bhur bhuvah suvah! I sacrifice brightness over thee. Svaha!'
1.24.3 There (near the sacrificial fire) he places a water-pot, walks round the fire (and that water-pot) keeping his right side turned towards it, makes (the wife) lie down to the west of the fire, facing east or north, and touches her secret parts, with (the formula), 'We touch thee with the five-forked, auspicious, unhostile (?), thousandfoldly blessed, glorious hand that thou mayst be rich in offspring!'
1.24.4 He then cohabits with her with (the formula), 'United is our soul, united our hearts, united our navel, united our skin. I will bind thee with the bond of love; that shall be insoluble.'
1.24.5 He then embraces her with (the formula), 'Be devoted to me; be my companion. What dwells in thee that is death-bringing to thy husband, that I make death-bringing to thy paramours. Bring luck to me; be a sharp-cutting (destroyer) to thy paramours.'
1.24.6 [*6] He then seeks her mouth with his mouth, with (the two verses), 'Honey! Lo! Honey! This is honey! my tongue's speech is honey; in my mouth dwells the honey of the bee; on my teeth dwells concord. The (magic charm of) concord that belongs to the kakravaka birds, that is brought out of the rivers, of which the divine Gandharva is possessed, thereby we are concordant.'
1.24.7 [*7] A woman that has her monthly courses, keeps through a period of three nights the observances prescribed in the Brahmana.
1.24.8 In the fourth night (the husband) having sipped water, calls (the wife) who has taken a bath, who wears a clean dress and ornaments, and has spoken with a Brahmana, to himself (with the following verses):
1.25.1 [*1] (a) 'May Vishnu make thy womb ready; may Tvashtri frame the shape (of the child); may Pragapati pour forth (the sperm); may Dhatri give thee conception! (b) 'Give conception, Sinivali; give conception, Sarasvati! May the two Asvins, wreathed with lotus, give conception to thee! (c) 'The embryo which the two Asvins produce with their golden kindling-sticks: that embryo we call into thy womb, that thou mayst give birth to it after ten months. (d) [*d] 'As the earth is pregnant with Agni, as the heaven is with Indra pregnant, as Vayu dwells in the womb of the regions (of the earth), thus I place an embryo into thy womb. (e) 'Open thy womb; take in the sperm; may a male child, an embryo be begotten in the womb. The mother bears him ten months; may he be born, the most valiant of his kin. (f) 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here, thy son, after ten months. (g) [*g] 'I do with thee (the work) that is sacred to Pragapati; may an embryo enter thy womb. May a child be born without deficiency, with all its limbs, not blind, not lame, not sucked out by Pisakas. (h) [*h] 'By the superior powers which the bulls shall produce for us, thereby become thou pregnant; may he be born, the most valiant of his kin. (i) [*i] 'Indra has laid down in the tree the embryo of the sterile cow and of the cow that prematurely produces; thereby become thou pregnant; be a well-breeding cow' -- And (besides with the two Mantras), 'United are our names' (above, 24, 4), and, 'The concord of the kakravaka birds' (24, 6).
1.25.2 (He should cohabit with her with the formulas), 'Bhuh! Through Pragapati, the highest bull, I pour forth (the sperm); conceive a valiant son, N.N.! Bhuvah! Through Pragapati, &c.--Suvah! Through Pragapati, &c.' Thus he will gain a valiant son.
1.25.3 The Mantras ought to be repeated whenever they cohabit, according to Atreya,
1.25.4 Only the first time and after her monthly courses, according to Badarayana.
1.26.1 The fire which (the sacrificer keeps) from the time of his marriage, is called the Aupasana (or sacred domestic fire)
1.26.2 With this fire the sacred domestic ceremonies are performed.
1.26.3 [*3] On account of his worship devoted to this (fire the sacrificer) is considered as an Ahitagni (i.e. as one who has set up the Srauta fires), and on account of his fortnightly Karu sacrifices (on the days of the new and full moon) as one who offers the sacrifices of the new and full moon (as prescribed in the Srauta ritual); so (is it taught).
1.26.4 If (the service at the domestic fire) has been interrupted for twelve days, the sacrificer ought to set the fire up again.
1.26.5 Or he should count all the sacrifices (that have been left out), and should offer them.
1.26.6 (The punaradhana or repeated setting up of the fire is performed in the following way): in an enclosed space, having raised (the surface), sprinkled it (with water), strewn it with sand, and covered it with Udumbara or Plaksha branches, he silently brings together the things belonging to (the sacrifice) according as he is able to get them, produces fire by attrition out of a sacrificially pure piece of wood, or gets a common fire, places it in a big vessel, sets it in a blaze, and puts (fuel) on it with the words, 'Bhuh! Bhuvah! Suvah! Om! Fixity!'
1.26.7 He then puts wood on the fire, performs (the rites) down to the Vyahriti oblations, and offers two 'minda oblations' (i.e. oblations for making up for defects) with (the two Mantras), 'If a defect (minda) has arisen in me,' (and), 'Agni has given me back my eye' (Taitt. Samh. III, 2, 5, 4).
1.26.8 He offers three 'tantu oblations' with (the Mantras), 'Stretching the weft (tantu)' (Taitt. Samh. III, 4, 2, 2), 'Awake, Agni!' (IV, 7, 13, 5), 'The thirty-three threads of the weft' (I, 5, 10, 4).
1.26.9 He offers four 'abhyavartin oblations' with (the Mantras), 'Agni who turns to us (abhyavartin)!' 'Agni Angiras!' 'Again with sap,' 'With wealth' (Taitt. Samh. IV. 2, 1, 2. 3).
1.26.10 [*10] Having made oblations with the single Vyahritis and with (the three Vyahritis together), and having made an oblation with the verse, 'Thou art quick, Agni, and free from imprecation. Verily (satyam) thou art quick. Held by us in our quick mind (manas), with thy quick (mind) thou carriest the offering (to the gods). Being quick bestow medicine on us! Svaha!'--this (last) oblation contains an allusion to the mind (manas), it refers to Pragapati, and alludes to the number seven (?),--he quickly repeats in his mind the dasahotri formula (Taitt. Arany. III, 1, 1). Then he makes the sagraha oblation (?); (then follow the oblations), 'This, O Varuna' (&c.; see I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sutra). Then he serves food to the Brahmanas and causes them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' he then performs in the known way the sacrifice of a mess of cooked food to Agni.
1.26.11 Here he gives an optional gift to his Guru: a pair of clothes, a milch cow, or a bull.
1.26.12 [*12] If he sets out on a journey, he makes the fire enter himself or the two kindling-sticks in the way that has been described (in the Srauta-sutra).
1.26.13 Or let him make it enter a piece of wood, in the same way as into the kindling-sticks.
1.26.14 A piece of Khadira wood, or of Palasa, or of Udumbara, or of Asvattha wood--
1.26.15 With one of these kinds of wood he fetches, where he turns in (on his journey), fire from the house of a Srotriya, and puts the (piece of wood) into which his fire has entered, on (that fire), with the two verses, 'He who has received the oblations' (Taitt. Samh. IV, 6, 5, 3), and 'Awake!' (IV, 7, 13, 5).
1.26.16 The way in which he sacrifices has been explained (in the Srauta-sutra).
1.26.17 If one half-monthly sacrifice has been omitted, he should have a sacrifice to (Agni) Pathikrit performed over this (fire). If two (half-monthly sacrifices), to (Agni) Vaisvanara and Pathikrit. If more than two, (the fire) has to be set up again.
1.26.18 If the fire is destroyed or lost, or if it is mixed with other fires, it has to be set up again.
1.27.1 If he will have a house built, he should during the northerly course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon, under the constellation Rohini and under the three constellations designated as Uttara (Uttara-Phalguni, Uttara-Ashadha, Uttara-Proshthapadah) put wood on the fire, perform the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations, and should sacrifice with (the verses), 'This, O Varuna' (&c.; see I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sutra). Then he serves food to the Brahmanas and causes them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' he puts on a garment that has not yet been washed, touches water, takes a shovel with (the formula), 'On the impulse of the god Savitri' (Taitt. Samh. I, 3, 1, 1) draws lines thrice from the left to the right round (the places where the pits for the posts shall be dug) with (the formula), 'A line has been drawn' (Taitt. Samh. I, 3, 1, 1), digs the pits (in which the posts shall be erected) as it is fit, and casts the earth (dug out of those pits) towards the inside (of the building-ground).
1.27.2 He erects the southern door-post with (the verse), 'Here I erect a firm house; it stands in peace, streaming ghee. Thus may we walk in thee, O house, blessed with heroes, with all heroes, with unharmed heroes;'
1.27.3 The northern (door-post) with (the verse), 'Stand here firmly, O house, rich in horses and cows, rich in delight; rich in sap, overflowing with milk be set up, for the sake of great happiness.'
1.27.4  With (the verse), 'To thee (may) the young child (go), to thee the calf with its companion, to thee the golden cup; to thee may they go with pots of curds'--he touches the two posts, after they have been erected.
1.27.5 In the same way (Sutras 2. 3) he erects the two chief posts,
1.27.6 And touches them as above (Sutra 4).
1.27.7 He fixes the beam of the roof on the posts with (the formula), 'Rightly ascend the post, O beam, erect, shining, drive off the enemies. Give us treasures and valiant sons.'
1.27.8  When the house has got its roof, he touches it with (the verse), 'The consort of honour, a blissful refuge, a goddess, thou hast been erected by the gods in the beginning; clothed in grass, cheerful thou art; bring us bliss, to men and animals.'
1.27.9 Then, under the constellation Anuradha, the ground (on which the house stands) is expiated (in the following way).
1.27.10 By night he puts wood on the fire in an inner room (of the house), performs the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations, and sacrifices (with the following Mantras):
1.28.1 [*1] The two verses commencing 'Vastoshpati!' (Taitt. Samh. III, 4, 10, 1). 'Vastoshpati! Be our furtherer; make our wealth increase in cows and horses, O Indu (i.e. Soma). Free from decay may we dwell in thy friendship; give us thy favour, as a father to his sons. Svaha! May death go away; may immortality come to us. May Vivasvat's son (Mama) protect us from danger. May wealth, like a leaf (that falls) from a tree, fall down over us. May Sakipati (i.e. Indra) be with us. Svaha! Go another way, O death, that belongs to thee, separated from the way of the gods. Vastoshpati! To thee who hears us, I speak: do no harm to our offspring nor to our heroes. Svaha! To this most excellent place of rest we have gone, by which we shall victoriously gain cows, treasures, and horses. May wealth, like a leaf (that falls) from a tree, fall down over us. May Sakipati be with us. Svaha! This, O Varuna' (&c.; see chap. 27, Sutra 1, down to): 'Hail! Good luck!'
1.28.2 In this way the ground (on which the house stands) should be expiated every year;
1.28.3 Every season, according to some (teachers).
1.29.1 [*1] 'House, do not fear, do not tremble; bringing strength we come back. Bringing strength, gaining wealth, wise I come back to the house, rejoicing in my mind. 'Of which the traveller thinks, in which much joy dwells, the house I call. May it know us as we know it. Hither are called the cows; hither are called goats and sheep; and the sweet essence of food is called hither to our house. Hither are called many friends, the sweet companionship of friends. May our dwellings always be unharmed with all our men. Rich in sap, rich in milk, refreshing, full of joy and mirth, free from hunger (?) and thirst, O house, do not fear us'--with (these verses) he approaches his house (when returning from a journey).
1.29.2 'To thee I turn for the sake of safety, of peace. The blissful one! The helpful one!, Welfare! Welfare!'--with (this formula) he enters.
1.29.3 On that day, on which he has arrived, he should avoid all quarrelling.
1.29.4 'The joyful house I enter which does not bring death to men; most manly (I enter) the auspicious one. Bringing refreshment, with genial minds (we enter the house); joyfully I lie down in it'--with (this verse) he lies down.
1.29.5 [*5] 'May we find our way with thee through all hostile powers, as through streams of water'--with (this verse) he looks at his wife; he looks at his wife.
2.1.1 Now (follows) the Simantonnayana (or parting of the pregnant wife's hair).
2.1.2 In the fourth month of her first pregnancy, in the fortnight of the increasing moon, under an auspicious constellation he puts wood on the fire, performs the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations, and makes four oblations to Dhatri with (the verse), 'May Dhatri give us wealth' (and the following three verses, Taitt. Samh. III, 3, II, 2. 3).
2.1.3 [*3] 'This, O Varuna' (&c.; see I, chap. 27, Sutra 2, down to): 'Hail! Good luck!' He then makes the wife who has taken a bath, who wears a clean dress and ornaments, and has spoken with a Brahmana, sit down to the west of the fire, facing the east, in a round apartment. Standing to the east (of the wife), facing the west he parts her hair upwards (i.e. beginning from the front) with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, holding (also) a bunch of unripe fruits, with the Vyahritis (and) with the two (verses), 'I invoke Raka,' (and), 'Thy graces, O Raka' (Taitt. Samh. III, 3, 11, 5). Then he recites over (his wife the formulas), 'Soma alone is our king, thus say the Brahmana tribes, sitting near thy banks, O Ganga, whose wheel does not roll back (?)!' (and), 'May we find our way with thee through all hostile powers, as through streams of water' (above I, 20, 5).
2.2.1 Now (follows) the Pumsavana (i.e. the ceremony for securing the birth of a male child).
2.2.2 [*2] In the third month, in the fortnight of the increasing moon, under an auspicious constellation (&c.; see the preceding section, Sutras 2 and 3, down to:) in a round apartment. He gives her a barley-grain in her right hand with (the formula), 'A man art thou;'
2.2.3 With (the formula), 'The two testicles are ye,' two mustard seeds or two beans, on both sides of that barley-grain.
2.2.4 With (the formula), 'Svavritat' (? svavrittat?) (he pours) a drop of curds (on those grains). That he gives her to eat.
2.2.5 After she has sipped water, he touches her belly with (the formula), 'With my ten (fingers) I touch. thee that thou mayst give birth to a child after ten months.'
2.2.6 [*6] (He pounds) the last shoot of a Nyagrodha trunk (and mixes the powder) with ghee, or a silkworm (and mixes the powder) with a pap prepared of panick seeds, or a splinter of a sacrificial post taken from the north-easterly part (of that post) exposed to the fire, or (he takes ashes or soot [?] of) a fire that has been kindled by attrition, and inserts that into the right nostril of (the wife) whose head rests on the widely spread root (of an Udumbara tree?).
2.2.7 If she miscarries, he should three times stroke (her body), from the navel upwards, with her wet hand, with (the formula), 'Thitherwards, not hitherwards, may Tvashtri bind thee in his bonds. Making (the mother) enter upon the seasons, live ten months (in thy mother's womb); do not bring death to men.'
2.2.8 [*8] When her confinement has come, he performs the kshipraprasavana (i.e. the ceremony for accelerating the confinement). Having placed a water-pot near her head and a Turyanti plant near her feet, he touches her belly.
2.3.1 'As the wind blows, as the ocean waves, thus may the embryo move; may it come forth together with the after-birth'--with (this verse) he strokes (her body) from above downwards.
2.3.2 When the child is born, he lays an axe on a stone, and a piece of gold on that axe; after he has turned these things upside down (so that the stone lies uppermost), he holds the boy over them with (the two verses), 'Be a stone, be an axe, be insuperable gold. Thou indeed art the Veda called son; so live a hundred autumns. From limb by limb thou art produced; out of the heart thou art born. Thou indeed art the self (atman) called son; so live a hundred autumns.'
2.3.3 (The contents of this Sutra are similar to those of Paraskara I, 16, 2.)
2.3.4 They take the Aupasana (or regular Grihya) fire away, and they bring the Sutikagni (or the fire of the confinement).
2.3.5 That (fire) is only used for warming (dishes, etc.).
2.3.6 No ceremonies are performed with it except the fumigation (see the next Sutra).
2.3.7 [*7] He fumigates (the child) with small grains mixed with mustard seeds. These he throws into the coals (of the Sutikagni) (eleven times, each time with one of the following Mantras): (a) 'May Sanda and Marka, Upavira, Sandikera, Ulukhala, Kyavana vanish from here. Svaha! (b) 'Alikhat, Vilikhat, Animisha, Kimvadanta, Upasruti. Svaha! (c) 'Aryamna, Kumbhin, Satru, Patrapani, Nipuni. Svaha! (d) 'May Antrimukha, Sarshaparuna vanish from here. Svaha! (e) 'Kesini, Svalomini, Bagaboga, Upakasini--go away, vanish from here. Svaha! (f) 'The servants of Kuvera, Visvavasa (?), sent by the king of demons, all of one common origin, walk through the villages, visiting those who wake (?). Svaha! (g) '"Kill them! Bind them!" thus (says) this messenger of Brahman. Agni has encompassed them. Indra knows them; Brihaspati knows them; I the Brahmana know them who seize (men), who have prominent teeth, rugged hair, hanging breasts. Svaha! (h) 'The night-walkers, wearing ornaments on their breasts, with lances in their hands, drinking out of skulls! Svaha! (i) 'Their father Ukkaihsravyakarnaka walks (?) at their head, their mother walks in the rear, seeking a vikhura (?) in the village. Svaha! (k) 'The sister, the night-walker, looks at the family through the rift (?)--she who wakes while people sleep, whose mind is turned on the wife that has become mother. Svaha! (l) 'O god with the black path, Agni, burn the lungs, the hearts, the livers of those (female demons); burn their eyes. Svaha!'
2.3.8 [*8] Then he washes his hands and touches the ground with (the verses), 'O thou whose hair is well parted! Thy heart that dwells in heaven, in the moon: of that immortality impart to us. May I not weep over distress (falling to my lot) through my sons. I know thy heart, O earth, that dwells in heaven, in the moon: thus may I, the lord of immortality, not weep over distress (falling to my lot) through my sons.'
2.3.9 Now (follows) the medhaganana (or production of intelligence). With (an instrument of) gold over which he has laid a Darbha shoot tied (to that piece of gold) he gives to the child, which is held so that it faces the east, ghee to eat, with the formulas, 'Bhuh! I sacrifice the Rikas over thee! Bhuvah! I sacrifice the Yagus over thee! Suvah! I sacrifice the Samans over thee! Bhur bhuvah suvah! I sacrifice the Atharvan and Angiras hymns over thee!'
2.3.10 [*10] He then bathes the child with lukewarm water with (the following Mantras): 'From chronic disease, from destruction, from wile, from Varuna's fetter I release thee. I make thee guiltless before the Brahman; may both Heaven and Earth be kind towards thee. May Agni together with the waters bring thee bliss, Heaven and Earth together with the herbs; may the air together with the wind bring thee bliss; may the four quarters of the heaven bring thee bliss. Rightly have the gods released the sun from darkness and from the seizing demon; they have dismissed him from guilt; thus I deliver this boy from chronic disease, from curse that comes from his kin, from wile, from Varuna's fetter.'
2.3.11 He then places the child in his mother's lap with (the verse):
2.4.1 'The four divine quarters of the heaven, the consorts of Wind, whom the sun surveys: to their long life I turn thee; may consumption go away to destruction!'
2.4.2 [*2] Having placed (him there) he addresses (his wife with the Mantra), 'May no demon do harm to thy son, no cow that rushes upon him (?). Mayst thou become the friend of treasures; mayst thou live in prosperity in thy own way.'
2.4.3 He washes her right breast and makes her give it to the child with (the formula), 'May this boy suckle long life; may he reach old age. Let thy breast be exuberant for him, and life, glory, renown, splendour, strength.'
2.4.4 In the same way the left breast.
2.4.5 With (the words), 'He does not suffer, he does not cry, when we speak to him and when we touch him'--he touches both breasts. Then he places a covered water-pot near her head, with (the formula), 'O waters, watch in the house. As you watch with the gods, thus watch over this wife, the mother of a good son.'
2.4.6 On the twelfth day the mother and the son take a bath.
2.4.7 They make the house clean.
2.4.8 [*8] They take the Sutikagni away, and they bring the Aupasana fire.
2.4.9 Having put wood on that fire, and having performed the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations, they sacrifice twelve oblations with the verses, 'May Dhatri give us wealth' (III, 3, II, 2-5); according to some (teachers they make) thirteen (oblations).
2.4.10 'This, O Varuna' (&c.; see I, chap. 27, Sutra 2, down to): 'Hail! Good luck!' Then let him give a name to the child, of two syllables or of four syllables, beginning with a sonant, with a semi-vowel in it, with a long vowel (or) the Visarga at its end, or a name that contains the particle su, for such a name has a firm foundation; thus it is understood.
2.4.11 [*11] Let the father and the mother pronounce (that name) first. For it is understood, 'My name first, O Gatavedas.'
2.4.12 He should give him two names. For it is understood (Taitt. Samh. VI, 3, I, 3), 'Therefore a Brahmana who has two names, will have success.'
2.4.13 [*13] The second name should be a Nakshatra name.
2.4.14 The one name should be secret; by the other they should call him.
2.4.15 He should give him the name Somayagin (i.e. performer of Soma sacrifices) as his third name; thus it is understood.
2.4.16 When he returns from a journey, or when his son returns, he touches him with (the formula), 'With Soma's lustre I touch thee, with Agni's splendour, with the glory of the sun.'
2.4.17 [*17] With (the formula), 'With the humkara (the mystical syllable hum) of the cattle I kiss thee, N.N.! For the sake of long life and of glory! Hum!' he kisses his head. Then he seizes with his right hand (his son's) right hand together with the thumb, with the five sections, 'Agni is long-lived.'
2.4.18 [*18] 'May Agni bestow on thee long life everywhere' (Taitt. Samh. I, 3, 14, 4)--this (verse) he murmurs in (his son's) right ear as above.
2.5.1 Then (follows) in the sixth month the Annaprasana (i.e. the first feeding with solid food).
2.5.2 In the fortnight of the increasing moon, under an auspicious constellation, he puts wood on the fire, performs the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations, and sacrifices (with the Mantras), 'This, O Varuna' (&c.; see I, chap. 27, Sutra 2, down to): 'Hail! Good luck!' Then he gives (to the child) threefold food to eat, curds, honey, and ghee, with (the formula), 'Bhuh I lay into thee! Bhuvah I lay into thee! Suvah I lay into thee!'
2.5.3 Then he gives him (other) food to eat with (the formula), 'I give thee to eat the essence of water and of the plants. May water and plants be kind towards thee. May water and plants do no harm to thee.'
2.6.1 In the third year (he performs) the Kudakarman (i.e. the tonsure of the child's head).
2.6.2 In the fortnight (&c., as in the preceding section, Sutra 2, down to): 'Hail! Good luck!' The boy sits down to the west of the fire, facing the east;
2.6.3 [*3] To the north (of the fire) his mother or a student (brahmakarin) holds a lump of bull's dung;
2.6.4 Therewith he (or she) receives the (cut-off) hair.
2.6.5 He then pours cold and warm water together.
2.6.6 [*6] Having poured warm water into cold water he moistens the hair near the right ear with (the formula), 'May the waters moisten thee for life' (Taitt. Samh. I, 2, I, 1).
2.6.7 [*7] With (the formula), 'Herb, protect him!' (Taitt. Samh., loc. cit.) he puts an herb, with its point upwards, into (the hair).
2.6.8 With (the formula), 'Axe, do no harm to him!' (Taitt. Samh., loc. cit.) he touches (that herb) with the razor.
2.6.9 With (the words), 'Heard by the gods, I shave that (hair)' (Taitt. Samh., loc. cit.) he shaves him.
2.6.10 In the same way (he moistens, &c.) the other (sides of his head) from left to right.
2.6.11 Behind with (the Mantra), 'The razor with which Savitri, the knowing one, has shaven (the beard) of king Soma and Varuna, with that, ye Brahmanas, shave his (head); make that he be united with vigour, with wealth, with glory.' On the left side with (the Mantra), '(The razor) with which Pushan has shaven (the beard) of Brihaspati, of Agni, of Indra, for the sake of long life, with that I shave thy (head), N.N.!' Before with (the Mantra), 'That he may long live in joy, and may long see the sun.'
2.6.12 After the hair has been shaven, they arrange the locks (which are left over), according to custom or according to what family he belongs.
2.6.13 [*13] A person who is kindly disposed towards him, gathers the (cut-off) hair and buries it in a cow-stable, or near an Udumbara tree, or in a clump of Darbha grass, with (the Mantra), 'Where Pushan, Brihaspati, Savitri, Soma, Agni (dwell), they have in many ways searched where they should depose it, between heaven and earth, the waters and heaven.'
2.6.14 [*14] He makes a gift to a Brahmana according to his liberality.
2.6.15 To the barber (he gives) boiled rice with butter.
2.6.16 In the same way the Godanakarman (or the ceremony of shaving the beard) is performed in the sixteenth year.
2.6.17 He has him shaven including the top-lock.
2.6.18 Some declare that he leaves there the top-lock.
2.6.19 [*19] Or he performs the Godana sacred to Agni.
2.6.20 He gives a cow to his Guru.
2.7.1 [*1] Now (follows) the expiation for attacks of the dog-demon (epilepsy) (on the boy).
2.7.2 [*2] When the attack assails (the boy, the performer of the ceremony) arranges his sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, sips water, and fetches water with a cup that has not yet been used (in order to pour it upon the boy). In the middle of the hall he elevates (the earth at) that place in which they use to gamble; he besprinkles it with water, casts the dice, scatters them (on all sides), makes a heap of them, spreads them out, makes an opening in the thatched roof of the hall, takes the boy in through that (opening), lays him on his back on the dice, and pours a mixture of curds and salt-water upon him, while they beat a gong towards the south. (The curds and water are poured on the sick boy with the following Mantras), 'Kurkura, Sukurkura, the Kurkura with the dark fetter . . . . Sarameya runs about, looking, as it were, upon the sea. He, the Suvirina (?), wears golden ornaments on his neck and on his breast, the most excellent (ornaments) of dogs (?). Suvirina, let him loose! Let him loose, Ekavratya! Let him loose, doggy! Let him loose, Khat! Teka and Sasaramatamka and Tula and Vitula and the white one and the red one. Let him loose! . . . . the brown and red one. On those two single ones the sarasyakas (?) run down in the third heaven from here. Khat! Go away. Sisarama! Sarameya! Adoration to thee, Sisara! Your mother is called the messenger; your father is the mandakaka (mandukaka, the frog?). Khat! Go away, &c. Your mother is called dula (the staggering one?); your father is the mandakaka. Khat! Go away, &c. The stallions (stamp with) their feet. Do not gnash (?) thy teeth. Khat! Go away, &c. The carpenter hammers at (the chariots) that have wheels (?). Do not gnash (?) thy teeth. Khat! Go away,' &c.
2.7.3 Then (the performer of the ceremony) says, 'Choose a boon.'
2.7.4 (The father or brother of the boy replies), 'I choose the boy.'
2.7.5 [*5] They should do so, when the attack assails him, three times in the day, in the morning, at noon, and in the afternoon, and when he has recovered.
  
2.8.1 [*1] Now (follows) the sacrifice of the sulagava (or spit-ox, for propitiating Rudra and averting plague in cattle).
2.8.2 In the fortnight of the increasing moon, under an auspicious constellation, he puts wood on the fire, strews (Darbha grass) on the entire surface around the fire, cooks a mess of sacrificial food with milk, sprinkles it (with Agya), takes it from the fire, builds two huts to the west of the fire, and has the spit-ox led to the southerly (hut) with (the verse), 'May the fallow steeds, the harmonious ones, bring thee hither, together with the white horses, the bright, wind-swift, strong ones, that are as quick as thought. Come quickly to my offering, Sarva! Om!'
2.8.3 [*3] To the northerly (hut he has) the 'bountiful one' (led);--(i.e. the consort of the spit-ox);
2.8.4 To the middle (between the two huts) the 'conqueror' (i.e. a calf of those two parents).
2.8.5 He gives them water to drink in the same order in which they have been led (to their places), prepares three messes of boiled rice, 'spreading under' and sprinkling (Agya) on them, and touches (the three beasts with those portions of rice) in the order in which they have been led (to their places), with (the Mantras), 'May he, the bountiful one, touch it. To the bountiful one svaha! May she, the bountiful one, touch it. To the bountiful one svaha! May the conqueror touch it. To the conqueror svaha!'
2.8.6 After he has performed (the rites) down to the Vyahriti oblations, he takes the messes of boiled rice (to the fire) and sacrifices them (the first with the Mantra), 'To the god Bhava svaha! To the god Rudra svaha! To the god Sarva svaha! To the god Isana . . . Pasupati . . . Ugra . . . Bhima svaha! To the great god svaha!'
2.8.7 Then he sacrifices the consort's rice to the consort (of Rudra, with the Mantra), 'To the consort of the god Bhava svaha! To the consort of the god Rudra . . . Sarva . . . Isana . . . Pasupati . . . Ugra . . . Bhima . . . of he great god svaha!'
2.8.8 Then he sacrifices of the middle portion of rice with (the Mantra), 'To the conqueror svaha! To the conqueror svaha!'
2.8.9 Then he cuts off from all the three portions of rice and sacrifices the Svishtakrit oblation with (the Mantra), 'To Agni Svishtakrit svaha!'
2.8.10 Around that fire they place their cows so that they can smell the smell of that sacrifice.
2.8.11 'With luck may they walk round our full face'--with (these words) he walks round all (the objects mentioned, viz. the fire, the three beasts, and the other cows), so as to turn his right side towards them, and worships (the sulagava) with the (eleven) Anuvakas, 'Adoration to thee, Rudra, to the wrath' (Taitt. Samh. IV, 5), or with the first and last of them.
2.9.1 [*1] Now follows the distribution of Palasa leaves (at different places).
2.9.2 'Protector of the house, touch them! To the protector of the house svaha! Protectress of the house, touch them! To the protectress of the house svaha! Protector of the door, touch them! To the protector of the door svaha! Protectress of the door, touch them! To the protectress of the door svaha!'--with (these formulas) he puts down four leaves; (then other leaves) with (the formulas), 'Noisy ones, touch them! To the noisy ones svaha! Quivered ones. . . ye that run in the rear . . . Minglers (?) . . . Choosers . . . Eaters, touch them! To the eaters svaha!'--
2.9.3 Then again ten (leaves) with (the formula), 'Divine hosts, touch them! To the divine hosts svaha!'
2.9.4 Then other ten (leaves) with (the formula), 'Divine hosts that are named and that are not named, touch them! To them svaha!'
2.9.5 [*5] Then he makes a basket of leaves, puts into it a lump of boiled rice with an 'under-spreading' (of Agya) and sprinkling (Agya) on it, goes outside his pasture-grounds, and hangs (the basket) up at a tree with (the formula), 'Quivered ones, touch it! To the quivered ones svaha!'
2.9.6 [*6] He then performs worship (before that basket) with (the formula), 'Adoration to the quivered one, to him who wears the quiver! To the lord of the thieves adoration!'
2.9.7 [*7] With sandal salve, sura and water, unground, fried grains, cow-dung, with a bunch of durva grass, with Udumbara, Palasa, Sami, Vikankata, and  Asvattha (branches), and with a cow-tail he besprinkles his cows, the bull first, with (the words), 'Bring luck! Bring luck!' Then (the bull) will bring him luck.
2.9.8 [*8] He then cooks that mess of sacrificial food, sacred to Kshetrapati (the lord of the field), with milk, sprinkles it (with Agya), takes it from the fire, and performs a sacrifice to Kshetrapati on the path where his cows use to go, without a fire, on four or on seven leaves.
2.9.9 He has him (i.e. the Kshetrapati? an ox representing Kshetrapati?) led (to his place) in the same way as the sulagava (chap. 8,  section 2).
2.9.10 [*10] He sacrifices quickly, (for) the god has a strong digestion (?).
2.9.11 He then performs worship with (the two verses), 'With the lord of the field,' 'Lord of the field' (Taitt. Samh. I, 1, 14, 2. 3).
2.9.12 Of (the remains of that sacrificial food) sacred to Kshetrapati his uterine relations should partake, according as the custom of their family is.
2.10.1 [*1] On the new-moon day, in the afternoon, or on days with an odd number in the dark fortnight the monthly (Sraddha is performed).
2.10.2 Having prepared food for the Fathers and having arranged southward-pointed Darbha grass as seats (for the Brahmanas whom he is going to invite), he invites an odd number of pure Brahmanas who are versed in the Mantras, with no deficient limbs, who are not connected with himself by consanguinity or by their Gotra or by the Mantras, (such as his teacher or his pupils).
2.10.3 In feeding them he should not look at any (worldly) purposes.
2.10.4 [*4] Having put wood on the fire and strewn southward pointed and eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it, having prepared the Agya in an Agya pot over which he has laid one purifier, having sprinkled water round (the fire) from right to left, and put a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire), he sacrifices with the (spoon called) Darvi which is made of Udumbara wood.
2.10.5 Having performed the rites down to the Agyabhaga offerings, he suspends his sacrificial cord over his right shoulder and calls the Fathers (to his sacrifice) with (the verse), 'Come hither, O Fathers, friends of Soma, on your hidden, ancient paths, bestowing on us offspring and wealth and long life, a life of a hundred autumns.'
2.10.6 [*6] He sprinkles water in the same direction (i.e. towards the south) with (the verse), 'Divine waters, send us Agni. May our Fathers enjoy this sacrifice. May they who receive their nourishment every month bestow on us wealth with valiant heroes.'
2.10.7 [*7] Having performed the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations with his sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, he suspends it over his right shoulder and sacrifices with (the following Mantras): 'To Soma with the Fathers, svadha! Adoration! 'To Yama with the Angiras and with the Fathers, svadha! Adoration! With the waters that spring in the east and those that come from the north: with the waters, the supporters of the whole world, I interpose another one between (myself and) my father. Svadha! Adoration! I interpose (another one) through the mountains; I interpose through the wide earth; through the sky and the points of the horizon, through infinite bliss I interpose another one between (myself and) my grandfather. Svadha! Adoration! I interpose (another one) through the seasons, through days and nights with the beautiful twilight. Through half-months and months I interpose another one between (myself and) my great-grandfather. Svadha! Adoration!' Then he sacrifices with their names: 'To N.N. svadha! Adoration! To N.N. svadha! Adoration!' 'Wherein my mother has done amiss, abandoning her duty (towards her husband), may my father take that sperm as his own; may another one fall off from the mother. Svadha! Adoration!' In the same way a second and a third verse with the alteration of the Mantra, 'Wherein my grandmother,' 'Wherein my great-grandmother.'
2.11.1 [*1] 'The Fathers who are here and who are not here, and whom we know and whom we do not know: Agni, to thee they are known, how many they are, Gatavedas. May they enjoy what thou givest them in our oblation. Svadha! Adoration! Your limb that this flesh-devouring (Agni) has burnt, leading you to the worlds (of the Fathers), Gatavedas, that I restore to you again. Unviolated with all your limbs arise, O Fathers! Svadha! Adoration! Carry the Agya, Gatavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them resting afar. May streams of Agya flow to them; may their wishes with all their desires be fulfilled! Svadha! Adoration!' In the same way a second and a third verse with the alteration of the Mantra, 'to the grandfathers,' 'to the great-grandfathers.'
2.11.2 In the same way he sacrifices of the food, altering the Mantra, 'Carry the food, &c.'
2.11.3 Then he sacrifices the Svishtakrit oblation with (the formula), 'To Agni Kavyavahana Svishtakrit svadha! Adoration!'
2.11.4 He then touches the food with (the formulas), 'The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid. I sacrifice thee into the Brahman's mouth. I sacrifice thee into the up-breathing and down-breathing of the Brahmanas. Thou art imperishable; do not perish for the Fathers yonder, in yon world! The earth is steady; Agni is its surveyor in order that what has been given may not be lost. The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid, &c. Do not perish for the grandfathers yonder, in yon world. The air is steady; Vayu is its surveyor, in order that what has been given may not be lost. The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid, &c. Do not perish for the great-grandfathers yonder, in yon world. The heaven is steady; Aditya is its surveyor, in order that what has been given may not be lost.'
2.11.5 [*5] With (the words), 'I establish myself in the breath and sacrifice ambrosia,' he causes the Brahmanas to touch (the food).
2.12.1 While they are eating, he looks at them with (the words), 'My soul (atman) dwells in the Brahman that it may be immortal.'
2.12.2 When they have eaten (and go away), he goes after them and asks for their permission to take the remains of their meal (for the rites which he is going to perform). Then he takes a water-pot and a handful of Darbha grass, goes forth to a place that lies in a south-easterly intermediate direction, spreads the Darbha grass out with its points towards the south, and pours out on that (grass) with downward-turned hands, ending in the south, three handfuls of water, with (the formulas), 'May the fathers, the friends of Soma, wipe themselves! May the grandfathers . . . the great-grandfathers, the friends of Soma, wipe themselves!' or, 'N.N.! Wash thyself! N.N.! Wash thyself!'
2.12.3 [*3] On that (grass) he puts down, with downward-turned hands, ending in the south, the lumps (of food for the Fathers). To his father he gives his lump with (the words), 'This to thee, father, N.N.!' to the grandfather with (the words), 'This to thee, grandfather, N.N.!' to the great-grandfather with (the words), 'This to thee, great-grandfather, N.N.!' silently a fourth (lump). This (fourth lump) is optional.
2.12.4 Should he not know the names (of the ancestors), he gives the lump to the father with (the words), 'Svadha to the Fathers who dwell on the earth,' to the grandfather with (the words), 'Svadha to the Fathers who dwell in the air,' to the great-grandfather with (the words), 'Svadha to the Fathers who dwell in heaven.'
2.12.5 Then he gives, corresponding to each lump, collyrium and (other) salve and (something that represents) a garment.
2.12.6 [*6] The collyrium (he gives), saying three times, 'Anoint thy eyes, N.N.! Anoint thy eyes, N.N.!'
2.12.7 The salve, saying three times, 'Anoint thyself, N.N.! Anoint thyself, N.N.!'
2.12.8 [*8] With (the formula), 'These garments are for you, O Fathers. Do not seize upon anything else that is ours,' he tears off a skirt (of his garment) or a flake of wool and puts that down (for the Fathers), if he is in the first half of his life.
2.12.9 He tears out some hairs of his body, if in the second half.
2.12.10 Then he washes the vessel (in which the food was of which he had offered the lumps), and sprinkles (the water with which he has washed it), from right to left round (the lumps) with (the Mantra), 'These honey-sweet waters, bringing refreshment to children and grandchildren, giving sweet drink and ambrosia to the Fathers, the divine waters refresh both (the living and the dead), these rivers, abounding in water, covered with reeds, with beautiful bathing-places; may they flow up to you in yon world!' Then he turns the vessel over, crosses his hands so that the left hand becomes right and the right hand becomes left, and worships (the Fathers) with the formulas of adoration, 'Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of sap' (Taitt. Samh. III, 2, 5, 5).
2.12.11 Then he goes to the brink of some water and pours down three handfuls of water (with the following Mantras):
2.13.1 'This is for thee, father, this honey-sweet wave, rich in water. As great as Agni and the earth are, so great is its measure, so great is its might. As. such a great one I give it. As Agni is imperishable and inexhaustible, thus may it be imperishable and inexhaustible, sweet drink to my father. By that imperishable (wave), that sweet drink, live thou together with those, N.N.! The Rikas are thy might. This is for thee, grandfather, &c. . . . As great as Vayu and the air are . . . As Vayu is imperishable . . . to my grandfather. . . . The Yagus are thy might. This is for thee, great-grandfather, &c. . . . As great as Aditya and the heaven are . . . "The Samans are thy might.'
2.13.2 Returning (from the place where he has performed the Pinda offerings) he puts the substance cleaving (to the Sthali) into the water-pot and pours it out, with (the verse), 'Go away, O Fathers, friends of Soma, on your hidden, ancient paths. After a month return again to our house and eat our offerings, rich in offspring, in valiant sons.'
2.13.3 [*3] Thereby the (Sraddha) celebrated in the middle of the rainy season has been declared.
2.13.4 There (oblations of) flesh are prescribed;
2.13.5 Of vegetables, if there is no flesh.
2.14.1 [*1] We shall explain (the festival of) the Ashtaka.
2.14.2 The eighth day of the dark fortnight that follows after the full moon of Magha, is called Ekasntaka.
2.14.3 On the day before that Ashtaka, under (the Nakshatra) Anuradhas, in the afternoon he puts wood on the fire, strews southward-pointed and eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it, and turns rice out of four shallow cups over which he has laid one purifier, with (the Mantra), 'I turn out, impelled by the god Savitri, this cake prepared from four cups (of rice), which may drive away all suffering from the Fathers in the other world. On the impulse of the god Savitri, with the arms of the two Asvins, with Pushan's hands I turn thee out, agreeable to the fathers, the grandfathers, the great-grandfathers.'
2.14.4 [*4] With the same purifier he silently strains the Prokshani water; he silently sprinkles (with that water the rice and the vessels), silently husks (the rice), silently bakes it in four dishes like a Purodasa, sprinkles (Agya) on it, takes it from the fire, sprinkles (water) round (the fire) from right to left, and puts a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire). With the (spoon called) Darvi which is made of Udumbara wood, he cuts off in one continual line which is directed towards south-east, (the Avadana portions) one after the other, spreading under and sprinkling over them (Agya), and sacrifices them, one after the other, in one continual line which is directed towards south-east, with (the Mantras), 'The mortars, the pressing-stones have made their noise, preparing the annual offering. Ekashtaka! May we be rich in offspring, in valiant sons, the lords of wealth. Svadha! Adoration! God Agni! The cake which is prepared with ghee and accompanied by (the word) svadha, that the Fathers may satiate themselves--(this our) offering carry duly, Agni. I, the son, sacrifice an oblation to my fathers. Svadha! Adoration! Here is a cake, Agni, prepared from four cups (of rice), with ghee, rich in milk, in wealth, in prosperity. May the Fathers gladly accept it all together; may it be well sacrificed and well offered by me. Svadha! Adoration!'
2.14.5 Then he makes oblations of (other) food with (the verses), 'The one who shone forth as the first,' 'The Ekashtaka, devoting herself to austerities,' 'She who shone forth as the first' (Taitt. Samhita IV, 3, 11, I. 3. 5).
2.14.6 Cutting off (the Avadanas destined for the Svishtakrit oblation) together from the cake and from the (other) food and mixing them with clarified butter, he makes an oblation thereof with (the formula), 'To Agni Kavyavahana Svishtakrit svadha! Adoration!'
2.14.7 [*7] That (cake) with ghee and honey and with the food (mentioned in Sutras 5. 6) he touches in the way prescribed for the Sraddha ceremony and puts down lumps (of it) according to the ritual of the Pinda offerings.
2.14.8 (The remains of) that (cake, &c.) he serves to learned Brahmanas.
2.14.9 He gives them food and presents as at the Sraddha ceremony.
2.14.10 [*10] The known (rites) down to the pouring out of the handfuls of water (are performed here) as at the monthly (Sraddha).
2.15.1 On the following day he sacrifices a cow to the Fathers.
2.15.2 [*2] Having put wood on the fire and strewn southward-pointed and eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it, he sacrifices the oblation for the touching of the animal (see below), with (the verse), 'This cow I touch for the Fathers; may my assembled fathers gladly accept it (which is offered) with fat and ghee, with the word svadha; may it satiate my fathers in the other world. Svadha! Adoration!' Then he touches (the cow) with one (blade of) sacrificial grass and with an unforked Vapasrapani of Udumbara wood, with (the formula), 'I touch thee agreeable to the Fathers.'
2.15.3 He sprinkles (the cow with water) with (the words), 'I sprinkle thee agreeable to the Fathers.'
2.15.4 [*4] When it has been sprinkled and fire has been carried round it, they kill it to the west of the fire, its head being turned to the west, its feet to the south.
2.15.5 [*5] After it has been killed, he silently 'strengthens' its sense-organs (by touching them) with water, and silently takes out the omentum, the heart, and the kidneys.
2.15.6 With the Vapasrapani of Udumbara wood he roasts the omentum; with spits of Udumbara wood the other (parts mentioned in Sutra 5) separately.
2.15.7 After he has roasted them, and has sprinkled Agya over them, and has taken them from the fire, he sprinkles water round (the fire) from right to left, puts a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire), and sacrifices with a Darvi spoon of Udumbara wood the omentum, spreading under and sprinkling over it (Agya), with (the verse), 'Carry the omentum, Gatavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them resting afar. May streams of fat flow to them; may their wishes with all their desires be fulfilled. Svadha! Adoration!'
2.15.8 [*8] He sacrifices the omentum entirely. The other parts (Sutra 5) he should offer to the Brahmanas and should feed them (with those parts of the cow).
2.15.9 When the food (for the Brahmanas) is ready, he cuts off (the Avadanas) together from the mess of boiled rice, and from the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes oblations thereof with the verses, 'Behold the Ekashtaka, the giver of food with meat and ghee, (which is offered) with (the word) svadha. By the Brahmanas that food is purified. May it be an imperishable (blessing) to me! Svadha! Adoration!' 'The Ekashtaka, devoting herself to austerities, the consort of the year, exuberant (with milk), has poured forth milk. May you live on that milk, O Fathers, all together. May this (food) be well offered and well sacrificed by me! Svadha! Adoration! The image of the year' (Taitt. Samh. V, 7, 2, 1).
2.15.10 After he has sacrificed, he cuts off (the Avadanas) from the food and from the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes an oblation with (the formula), 'To Agni Kavyavahana Svishtakrit svadha! Adoration!'
2.15.11 [*11] The known (rites) down to the pouring out of the handfuls of water (are performed here) as at the monthly (Sraddha).
2.15.12 [*12] The gifts of food and presents, however, are not necessary here.
2.15.13 [*13] On the following day, he prepares food for the Fathers with the rest of the meat, and sacrifices with (the two verses), 'Thou, Agni, art quick,' (and), Pragapati!' (see above, I, 1, 3, 5).
2.15.14 (= Sutra 11).
2.16.1 Now (follows) the Sravana ceremony.
2.16.2 On the day of that full moon which falls under (the Nakshatra) Sravana, after the evening Agnihotra he puts wood on the (third of the three Srauta fires, called the) Dakshinagni. One who has not set up the (Srauta) fires, (does the same with) the sacred domestic fire.
2.16.3 Then he procures unbroken grains, unbroken fried grains, coarsely ground grains, (leaves and blossoms) of the Kimsuka tree, collyrium and (other) salve, and Agya.
2.16.4 Having 'spread under' (Agya) in the (spoon called) Darvi, he cuts off (the Avadanas) of those kinds of food (mentioned in Sutra 3), mixes them with clarified butter, and sacrifices (with the formulas), 'Adoration to Agni the terrestrial, the lord of terrestrial beings! Svaha! Adoration to Vayu the all-pervading, the lord of aerial beings! Svaha! Adoration to Surya, the red one, the lord of celestial beings! Svaha! Adoration to Vishnu, the whitish one, the lord of the beings that dwell in the quarters (of the world). Svaha!'
2.16.5 [*5] He anoints the Kimsuka (flowers and leaves) with Agya, and sacrifices with (the Mantras), 'Devoured is the gadfly; devoured is thirst (?); devoured is the stinging worm.' 'Devoured is the stinging worm; devoured is thirst; devoured is the gadfly.'  'Devoured is thirst; devoured is the gadfly; devoured is the stinging worm.'
2.16.6 He takes a water-pot and a handful of Darbha grass, goes forth, his face turned towards the east, spreads the Darbha grass out with its points towards the east, and makes four Bali-offerings on that (grass) with (the formulas), 'To the terrestrial Serpents I offer this Bali,' 'To the aerial, &c.; to the celestial, &c.; to the Serpents dwelling in the quarters (of the world),' &c.
2.16.7 Having given there collyrium and (other) salve (to the Serpents), he worships them with the Mantras, 'Adoration be to the Serpents' (Taitt. Samhita IV, 2, 8, 3).
2.16.8 [*8] He should take a water-pot and should at that distance in which he wishes the serpents not to approach, three times walk round his house, turning his right side towards it, and should sprinkle water round it with (the formulas), 'Beat away, O white one, with thy foot, with the fore-foot and with the hind-foot, these seven human females and the three (daughters) of the king's tribe. Within the dominion of the white one the Serpent has killed nobody. To the white one, the son of Vidarva, adoration! Adoration to the white one, the son of Vidarva!'
2.16.9 Then he worships the Serpents towards the different regions, one by one with (the corresponding section of) these Mantras, 'The convergent one thou art called, the eastern region' (Taitt. Samh. V, 5, 10, 1 seq.).
2.16.10 From that time he daily makes the Bali-offerings till the full-moon day of Margasirsha.
2.16.11 Here the Kimsuka offerings (see  section 5) are not repeated.
2.16.12 The sprinkling (of water) round (the house) does not take place (see  section 8).
2.16.13 [*13] The last Bali he offers with (the words), 'Going to acquit myself, going to acquit myself.'
2.17.1 [*1] We shall explain the Agrahayani ceremony.
2.17.2 [*2] On the full-moon day of Margasirsha he puts wood on the fire, strews (Darbha grass) on the entire surface round the fire, cooks a mess of sacrificial food with milk, sprinkles it (with Agya), takes it from the fire, performs the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations, and sacrifices (four oblations) with (the following Mantras): 'This offering, the creeping of Ida, rich in ghee, moving and not moving, accept gladly, O Gatavedas. What domestic animals there are, of all shapes, all seven kinds of them: may they gladly dwell here and may they prosper. Svaha! The night which men welcome like a cow that comes to them, (the night) which is the consort of the year, may that (night) be auspicious to us. Svaha! Bringing bliss to the cattle, to the wife, bringing bliss by night and by day, may this (night) which is the consort of the year, be auspicious to us. Svaha! The full-moon night, bringing abundance, visiting one after another, dividing the months and fortnights: may this (night), the full one, protect us. Svaha!'
2.17.3 [*3] He sacrifices the oblation to Agni Svishtakrit with (the verse), 'Agni, make this (sacrifice) full that it may be well offered. Be victorious, O god, in all battles. Shine far and wide, showing us a wide path. Bestow on us long life, full of splendour and free from decay. Svaha!'
2.17.4 Then he washes his hands and touches the earth with (the formulas), 'In power I establish myself, in royalty. Among the horses I establish myself, among the cows. In the limbs I establish myself, in the self. In the Pranas I establish myself, in prosperity. In Heaven and Earth I establish myself, in sacrifice. May the three times eleven gods, the thirty-three, the gracious ones, whose Purohita is Brihaspati, on the impulse of the god Savitri--may the gods with (all) the gods give me bliss!'
2.17.5 The master of the house sits down at their southerly end,
2.17.6 The other persons to the north,
2.17.7 According to their seniority.
2.17.8 They who know the Mantras among them, murmur the Mantras (which will be stated).
2.17.9 With (the verse), 'Be soft to us, O earth, free from thorns; grant us rest; afford us wide shelter' (Taitt. Ar. X, 1, 10), and with the two (verses), 'Verily of the mountains' (Taitt. Samh. II, 2, 12, 2. 3) they lie down on their right sides.
2.17.10 With (the verse), 'Up! with life' (Taitt. Samh. I, 2, 8, 1) they arise.
2.17.11 When they have arisen, they murmur, 'We have arisen; we have become immortal.'
2.17.12 In that way they (lie down and) arise that night three times.
2.17.13 [*13] Having served food to the Brahmanas and having caused them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' they rest that night.
2.18.1 Now we shall explain the opening and the conclusion (of the annual course of study).
2.18.2 [*2] During the fortnight that precedes the Sravana full moon, when the herbs have appeared, under (the Nakshatra) Hasta or on the full-moon day (itself), the opening ceremony of the (annual course of) study (is performed).
2.18.3 Having put wood on the fire and performed the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations, he sacrifices (with his pupils) to the Rishis of the Kandas: 'To Pragapati, the Rishi of a Kanda, svaha! To Soma, the Rishi of a Kanda, svaha! To Agni, the Rishi of a Kanda, svaha! To the Visve devas, the Rishis of a Kanda, svaha! To Svayambhu, the Rishi of a Kanda, svaha!'--these are the Rishis of the Kandas. Or (he sacrifices) to the names of the Kandas, to the Savitri, to the Rig-veda, the Yagur-veda, the Sama-veda, the Atharva-veda, and to Sadasaspati.
2.18.4 Having (thus) sacrificed, they repeat the first three Anuvakas,
2.18.5 Or the beginnings of all Kandas.
2.18.6 He enters upon (sacrificing) the Gaya, &c. (oblations; see above, I, 1, 3, 8).
2.18.7 After all rites down to the Svishtakrit oblation have been performed, they stop studying three days or one day; then they should go on studying so as to commence where they have broken off: so say the teachers.
2.18.8 [*8] During the fortnight that precedes the Taishi full moon, under (the Nakshatra) Rohini or on the full-moon day (itself), the Utsarga (or conclusion of the term of study) is celebrated.
2.18.9 [*9] (The teacher) with his pupils goes in an easterly or northerly direction, and where they find a pleasant water with a pleasant bathing-place, they dive into it and perform three suppressions of the breath with the Agharmarshana hymn (Rig-veda X, 190 = Taitt. Ar. X, 1, 13. 14.). Holding purifiers (i.e. Darbha blades) in their hands they bathe with the three (verses), 'Ye waters, ye are wholesome' (Taitt. Samh. IV, 1, 5, 1), with the four (verses), 'The gold-coloured, pure, purifying waters' (T.S.V, 6, 1, 1 seq.), and with the Anuvaka, '(Soma) which clears itself, the heavenly being' (Taitt. Br. I, 4, 8): giving the Darbha blades to each other and feigning to try to seize (??) each other.
2.18.10 Then they arrange on a pure spot that is inclined towards the east, seats of eastward-pointed Darbha grass, so that they end in the north--
2.19.1 [*1] For Brahman, Pragapati, Brihaspati, Agni, Vayu, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, king Indra, king Yama, king Varuna, king Soma, king Vaisravana, for the Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas, the Visve devas, the Sadhyas, the Ribhus, the Bhrigus, the Maruts, the Atharvans, the Angiras: for these divine beings.
2.19.2 [*2] Visvamitra, Gamadagni, Bharadvaga and Gautama, Atri, Vasishtha, Kasyapa: these are the seven Rishis.
2.19.3 Wearing their sacrificial cords below (round their body) they arrange towards the north, at a place that is inclined towards the north, seats of northward-pointed Darbha grass, so that they end in the east, for Visvamitra, Gamadagni, Bharadvaga, Gautama, Atri, Vasishtha, Kasyapa.
2.19.4 Between Vasishtha and Kasyapa they arrange (a seat) for Arundhati, (the wife of Vasishtha);
2.19.5 Towards the south, in a place inclined towards the east, for Agastya.
2.19.6 Then for the (following) teachers, ending with those who teach (only) one Veda (?), viz. for Krishna Dvaipayana, Gatukanya, Taruksha, Trinabindu, Varmin, Varuthin, Vagin, Vagasravas, Satyasravas, Susravas, Sutasravas, Somasushmayana, Satvavat, Brihaduktha Vamadev(y)a, Vagiratna, Haryagvayana, Udamaya, Gautama, Rinangaya, Ritangaya, Kritangaya, Dhanangaya, Babhru, Tryaruna, Trivarsha, Tridhatu, Sibinta, Parasara, Vishnu, Rudra, Skanda, Kasisvara, Gvara, Dharma, Artha, Kama, Krodha, Vasishtha, Indra, Tvashtri, Kartri, Dhartri, Dhatri, Mrityu, Savitri, Savitri, and for each Veda, for the Rig-veda, the Yagur-veda, the Sama-veda, the Atharva-veda, the Itihasa and Purana.
2.19.7 Towards the south, with their sacrificial cords suspended over their right shoulders, in a place inclined towards the south, they arrange seats of southward-pointed Darbha grass, so that they end in the west--
2.20.1 [*1] For Vaisampayana, Palingu, Tittira [sic], Ukha, Atreya, the author of the Pada-text, Kaundinya the author of the commentary, for the authors of the Sutras, for Satyashadha (Hiranyakesin), for the handers-down of the text, for the teachers, the Rishis, the hermits dwelling in the woods, the chaste ones, for those who have only one wife.
2.20.2 They prepare (seats) each for his own fathers and maternal ancestors.
2.20.3 With (the words), 'For N.N. I prepare (a seat); for N.N. I prepare (a seat)' (he prepares) a seat.
2.20.4 With (the words), 'I satiate N.N.; I satiate N.N.' (he makes offerings of) water.
2.20.5 With (the words), 'Adoration to N: N.! Adoration to N.N.!' (he offers) perfumes, flowers, incense, and lamps.
2.20.6 With (the words), 'To N.N. svaha! To N.N. svaha!' (he offers) food.
2.20.7 With (the words), 'I satiate N.N.; I satiate N.N.' (he offers) water with fruits in it.
2.20.8 Having worshipped them with (the words), 'Adoration to N.N.! Adoration to N.N.!'--
2.20.9 [*9] Having put wood on the fire to the west of the surface (on which he had performed the Tarpana), and having performed the rites down to the Vyahriti oblations (&c., as above, chap. 18, 3-7).
2.20.10 With the two (verses), 'From joint to joint,' 'Thou who with a hundred' (Taitt. Samh. IV, 2, 9, 2) they plant Durva grass at the shore of the water.
2.20.11 They stir up waves in the water and run a race in an easterly or northerly direction until they lose their breath.
2.20.12 When they have returned (from that race? or when they have returned from the whole ceremony to the village?) they offer cakes, coarsely ground grain, and boiled rice to the Brahmanas.
2.20.13 [*13] The same (rites are repeated) when they have finished the study of the whole Veda, with the exception of the planting of Durva grass, of (stirring up) the water, and of the race.
2.20.14 Thus they satiate daily (after the Brahmayagna) the gods, the Rishis, and the Fathers with water; they satiate them with water.

1.1.1 [*1]. Now henceforth we shall declare the Pakayagnas.
1.1.2 [*2]. When (a pupil) is going to return (from his teacher), let him keep that fire (as his domestic fire) on which he has put the last piece of wood (as required by the regulations for a student),
1.1.3 Or (he should keep) his nuptial fire.
1.1.4 Some declare (that the domestic fire should be kindled) at the time of the division of the inheritance.
1.1.5 [*5]. Or that after the death of the householder the eldest one himself (should kindle it).
1.1.6 (It should be kindled) on the day of the new moon of the month of Vaisakha or on another (new moon day).
1.1.7 Some say (that the fire should be kindled) according to the (sacrificer's) wishes under the (corresponding) constellation.
1.1.8 [*8]. He should light his fire at one of the following places, viz. in the house of a Vaisya who is rich in cattle, at a frying-pan, or (at the fire of) one who offers many sacrifices.
1.1.9 [*9-11]. Some say that (the fire should be fetched from one of the above-mentioned places) in the evening and in the morning.
1.1.10 The inauguration (of the fire) by an evening offering should be learnt from the Adhvaryus, according to (my) teacher.
1.1.11 In the morning he shall offer a full oblation with a verse sacred to Vishnu, or silently.
1.1.12 [*12]. The time for setting it (i.e. the domestic fire) in a blaze and for sacrificing on it has been explained by (the rules given with regard to) the Agnihotra.
1.1.13 [*13]. And 'invested with the sacrificial cord,' etc., all these rules, as far as they are applicable, should be applied (here also) in consequence of the unity of the ritual.
1.1.14 With regard to this they quote also (the following Sloka):
1.1.15 [*15]. 'The kinds of Pakayagnas, the kinds of Haviryagnas, and again the kinds of Soma sacrifices, 'Twenty-one by number, these are proclaimed to be the kinds of sacrifice.'
1.2.1 At the end of the sacrificial acts (follows) the distribution of food to Brahmanas.
1.2.2 Voice, (pleasantness of) form, age, learning, moral character, (right) conduct are the qualities (required in the Brahmanas who are to be invited thereto).
1.2.3 Learning, however, outweighs every (other qualification).
1.2.4 A learned one should not be passed over.
1.2.5 'The threefold (knowledge, viz. that) which refers to the deities, that which refers to the Atman, and that which refers to sacrifice, '(Handed down) in the Mantras and in the Brahmana: this is called learning.
1.2.6 'A performer of the sacred rights, a man who has studied (the Veda), who is old in learning and devoted to austerities: 'He who gives food (even) once to such (a Brahmana), hunger will not befall that man any more.
1.2.7 'Whatsoever deity he may wish to satiate at any sacrifice, 'Destining it to that (deity) in his mind, he shall give (the food) to a person like that.
1.2.8 'An oblation deposited in a person like that will never miss its way to the deity; 'Treasure of men, vessel of gods (in which they receive what is given to them) he is called.'
1.3.1 [*1]. Now (follow) the ceremonies of the days of the new and full moon. He fasts.
1.3.2 [*2]. In the morning, when the sun shines on the top of the great trees, that is the most auspicious time for all kinds of sacrifices, unless there be a special rule.
1.3.3 [*3]. With a genial mind, clean, on a pure, protected spot, having cooked a full, thin mess of rice, he offers that cooked oblation to the deities of the festivals of the new and full moon, distributing it in the due way.
1.3.4 [*4]. In the oblations of cooked food the acts of taking (the intended oblation), of putting it down (near the fire), and of sprinkling it (with water) are performed with regard to the deities of the (respective) Mantras.
1.3.5 [*5]. And the rules about the portions to be cut off (from the sacrificial food, are valid).
1.3.6 [*6]. But before the sacrifices of the new and full moon one should make offerings to the deities of the Anvarambhaniya ceremony.
1.3.7 [*7]. The time for the new moon sacrifice is not elapsed until the full moon, nor that for the full moon sacrifice until the new moon.
1.3.8 [*8]. And some say that the morning oblation may be made at the time of the evening oblation, in the case of danger.
1.3.9 But the time is fixed, as at the Agnihotra an expiation has been prescribed for him who has neglected the time.
1.3.10 At the two daily oblations one should use as sacrificial food either rice or barley or grains.
1.3.11 In case these are not at hand, other (sorts of sacrificial food are) not prohibited.
1.3.12 Some say that if he uses grains, he should wash them.
1.3.13 With the other (kinds of food) no such preparation takes place.
1.3.14 [*14-15]. In the evening (he makes the oblation) to Agni, in the morning to Surya,
1.3.15 And after both silently to Pragapati.
1.3.16 Some (say that) before the first oblation a piece of wood (is to be put on the fire).
1.3.17 [*17]. The sprinkling with water as indicated (in the Srauta-sutra). The deities of the festivals of the new and full moon (i.e. of the rites which in the Srauta ritual correspond to that taught here) are, at the full moon, Agni and Agnishomau, at the new moon, Agni, Vishnu, and Indragni, who are preceded in both cases by Agni and Soma as the deities of the two agyabhagas (see below, ch. 9, 7), and followed by Agni Svishtakrit. For more detailed statements see Hillebrandt, Das altindische Neu- und Vollmondsopfer (Jena, 1879), pp. 102 seq.
1.4.1 [*1]. When he has risen in the morning and has sipped water, let him daily repeat his recital.
1.4.2 (This consists of, or is accompanied by, the following texts:) the two verses, 'To-day, god Savitar' (Rig-veda V, 82, 4-5); the hymn, 'Go away, Manasaspati' (X, 164); the hymn, 'Right and truth' (X, 190); the verses, 'Look down, ye Adityas,' to the end of the hymn (VIII, 47, 11-18); the verse, 'O Indra, the best treasures' (II, 21, 6); the verse, 'The swan dwelling in purity' (IV, 40, 5); the verse, 'Adoration to the great ones' (I, 27, 13); the verse, 'What we fear, Indra' (VIII, 50, 13); the verse, 'And of the sleep' (I, 120, 12); the verse, 'He who says to me, O king' (II, 28, 10); the hymn, 'Let glory be mine, Agni' (X, 128); and the five verses,' Bliss may create for us' (V, 51, 11 seq.).
1.5.1 [*1]. There are four kinds of Pakayagnas, viz. the HUTA, the AHUTA, the PRAHUTA, and the PRASITA.
1.5.2 [*2]. On the following five occasions, viz. the wedding, the tonsure (of the child's head), the initiation (of the Brahmakarin), the cutting of the beard, and the parting of the hair, (on these occasions) in the outer hall--
1.5.3 [*3]. To a place that has been smeared (with cow-dung), which is elevated, and which has been sprinkled (with water), he carries forward the fire,
1.5.4 Having kindled it by rubbing, according to some teachers, at his marriage.
1.5.5 During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day he shall seize the hand of a girl,
1.5.6 Who should possess (the auspicious) characteristics (required),
1.5.7 Whose limbs should be proportionate,
1.5.8 Whose hair should be smooth,
1.5.9 [*9]. Who should also have at her neck two curls turned to the right.
1.5.10 (Of such a girl) he shall know that she will give birth to six men. With regard to the fourfold division of Pakayagnas stated here comp. below, chap. 10, 7.
1.6.1 [*1]. If he will acquire a wife, let him recite over the wooers (whom he sends to the girl's father) when they go away, the verse, 'Thornless' (Rig-veda X, 85, 23).
1.6.2 When they arrive, they take flowers, fruits, barley, and a pot of water.
1.6.3 [*3]. They say thrice, 'Here I am, sir!'
1.6.4 When these words have been uttered, they ask the girl in marriage, reciting the clan names, the dwellers turning their faces to the east, the visitors to the west.
1.6.5 When the matter pleases both sides, let them touch a full vessel into which have been put flowers, fried grain, fruits, barley, and gold, and let them recite (the formula), 'Undisturbed art thou, the undisturbable vigour of the gods, not cursed, protecting against a curse, unexposed to a curse. Might I straightway attain to truth. Put me into prosperity.'
1.6.6 [*6]. With the verse, 'Offspring may produce us' (Rig-veda X, 85, 43), the Akarya of the girl's (family), standing up, places (the vessel) on her head (saying), 'Offspring I put into thee, cattle I put into thee, splendour and holy lustre I put into thee.'
1.7.1 [*1]. When assent has been declared (by the girl's father, the bridegroom) sacrifices.
1.7.2 He besmears a quadrangular space with cow-dung.
1.7.3 [*3]. (Let him consider in the ceremonies to be performed,) of the two eastern intermediate directions, the southern one as that to which (the rites) should be directed, if the rites belong to the Manes,
1.7.4 The northern one, if the rites belong to the gods,
1.7.5 Or rather the east (itself) according to some (teachers).
1.7.6 [*6-7]. He draws in the middle (of the sacrificial ground) a line from south to north,
1.7.7 Upwards from this, turned upwards, to the south one line, in the middle one, to the north one.
1.7.8 These he sprinkles (with water),
1.7.9 [*9]. Carries forward the fire with the verse, 'I carry forward Agni with genial mind; may he be the assembler of goods. Do no harm to us, to the old nor to the young; be a saviour to us, to men and animals,'
1.7.10 Or (he carries it forward) silently,
1.7.11 Then he wipes with his wet hand three times around the fire, turning his right side to it. This they call SAMUHANA (sweeping together).
1.7.12 Once, turning his left side to it, in the rites belonging to the Manes.
1.8.1 [*1]. Now (follows) the strewing (of grass) around (the fire).
1.8.2 He strews eastward-pointed Kusa grass around it, in three layers or in five layers,
1.8.3 Beginning on the east side, then to the west, then to the west.
1.8.4 He covers the roots (of the grass-blades) with the points.
1.8.5 And all kinds of rites are to be performed beginning south, ending north.
1.8.6 [*6]. He places the Brahman south with the words, BHUR BHUVAH SVAH,
1.8.7 Adorns him with flowers,
1.8.8 [*8]. Carries forward on the north side the Pranita waters with the words, 'Who carries ye forward?'--
1.8.9 [*9]. Takes up with the left hand the Kusa blades, and arranges them (on the ground) with the right hand,
1.8.10 Bending his right knee,
1.8.11 The left when worshipping the Manes.
1.8.12 The strewing around (of the grass) is not necessary in the Agya offerings,
1.8.13 [*13]. Nor in the standing offerings, according to Mandukeya.
1.8.14 [*14-16]. He now measures off with the span (of his hand) two Kusa blades, which are not unequal, with unbroken points, bearing no young shoots in them, and severs them (from their roots) with a Kusa blade, saying, 'Purifiers are ye.'
1.8.15 There are two or three (of these Kusa strainers).
1.8.16 He holds them with their points to the east and sprinkles them (with water, saying), 'Belonging to Vishnu.'
1.8.17 With the two Kusa blades he sprinkles (water) around the fire three times, keeping his right side turned towards it,
1.8.18 [*18]. Takes up the Agya pot with the words, 'Milk of the cows art thou;'
1.8.19 [*19]. Puts it on the fire with the words, 'For sap thee;'
1.8.20 [*20]. Takes it from the fire towards the north with the words, 'For juice thee;'
1.8.21 [*21]. And holding the two (Kusa) strainers with their points to the north, seizing them on both sides with his two thumbs and fourth fingers, he bends them down, the points upwards, and dips them into the Agya with the words, 'By the impulse of Savitar I purify thee with this uninjured purifier, with the rays of the good sun.'
1.8.22 (This) preparation of the Agya (takes place) each time.
1.8.23 Let him not offer (Agya) which has not been (thus) prepared.
1.8.24 [*24-25]. Also the waters in the Sruva spoon (he purifies) with the words, '(By the impulse) of Savitar (I purify) you.'
1.8.25 This (is called) the PRANITA and the PROKSHANI water.
1.9.1 [*1]. The Sruva spoon (serves as) a vessel.
1.9.2 According to the purpose the properties (of the different things to be used at each oblation) should be chosen.
1.9.3 [*3]. Taking up Kusa blades with the left, and the Sruva at its bottom with the right hand, with the words, 'The hand of Vishnu art thou'--
1.9.4 [*4]. He offers with the Sruva the Agya oblations.
1.9.5 [*5]. Beginning from the north-west side of the fire he offers (the Agya) unintermittingly on the south side (of the fire) with (the verse), 'Thou Agni art full of foresight' (Rig-veda I, 31, 10).
1.9.6 Beginning from the south-west side of the fire he unintermittingly offers on the north side with (the verse), 'To whom these snowy mountains' (Rig-veda X, 121, 4).
1.9.7 To Agni belongs the northern Agya portion, to Soma the southern.
1.9.8 [*8]. In the middle (are made) the other oblations,
1.9.9 (With the words,) 'Agni is the begetter; may he give to me N.N. as my wife; svaha! 'Soma is rich in wives; may he make me rich in wives by N.N.; svaha! 'Pushan is rich in kindred; may he make me rich in kindred by the father, the mother, the brothers of N.N.; svaha!'
1.9.10 [*10]. At the Agya oblations the offering of the two Agya portions and of the Svishtakrit oblation is not standing,
1.9.11 [*11]. Nor in the standing oblations, according to Mandukeya.
1.9.12 [*12]. The place for the insertion is the interval between the Mahavyahritis, the general expiation, and the oblation to Pragapati.
1.9.13 If the oblation consists in Agya, let him seize the Kusa blades in his left hand with his right hand at their points and with the left at their roots, and let him wet their points (with Agya) in the Sruva, the middle and the roots in the Agya pot;
1.9.14 In the oblations of cooked food, however, the points in the Sruk, the middle in the Sruva, the roots in the Agya pot.
1.9.15 When he then has thrown them (into the fire) with the words, 'Agni's garment art thou,'
1.9.16 And has put on (the fire) three pieces of wood,
1.9.17 [*17]. (Water) is sprinkled round (the fire) as stated above.
1.9.18 Oblations for which only the deities are indicated, but no texts prescribed, are to be made merely with the word SVAHA, 'To such and such a deity svaha! To such and such a deity svaha!'
1.9.19 [*19]. The ritual (here) declared of the sacrifice (to be performed) when (the father's) assent (to give away his daughter) has been declared--
1.10.1 [*1]. Forms the standard for all sacrifices that procure happiness,
1.10.2 And for all Agya offerings,
1.10.3 [*3]. For the sacrifice of animals which are tied to a branch,
1.10.4 [*4]. And for the offerings of boiled (rice) grains and of cooked food.
1.10.5 [*5]. These are performed, all the offerings of cooked food, without PRAYAGA and ANUYAGA oblations, without (the invocation of) the ILA, without NIGADA recitation, and without SAMIDHENI verses.
1.10.6 There are also the following Slokas:
1.10.7 [*7]. '(An oblation is called) HUTA, (if made) by the performing of the Agnihotra; AHUTA (i.e. unsacrificed, if) by the Bali offering; PRAHUTA (i.e. sacrificed up, if) by a sacrifice to the Manes; PRASITA (i.e. tasted, if) deposited as an offering in a Brahmana.
1.10.8 [*8]. 'Without raising his knees, with spread knees let him always offer his oblation; for the gods never accept an offering (that has been made holding the hand) not between (the knees).
1.10.9 [*9]. 'But when he has repeated a text sacred to Rudra, to the Rakshas, to the Manes, to the Asuras, or that contains an imprecation, let him touch water, and so also when he has touched his own body.'
1.11.1 [*1]. Now when the bride is to be carried away (to the bridegroom's house) that night, or on the next, or on the third night,
1.11.2 [*2]. On that night, when (the darkness of) night is gone, they wash the girl up to her head with (water that has been made fragrant by) all sorts of herbs and the choicest fruits together with scents;
1.11.3 They put on her a newly-dyed garment or (a new one) which has not yet been washed;
1.11.4 [*4]. Then (the Akarya of the bride's family) makes the girl sit down behind the fire, and while she takes hold of him he sacrifices with the Mahavyahritis, and then he makes Agya oblations to Agni, to Soma, to Pragapati, to Mitra, to Varuna, to Indra, to Indrani, to the Gandharva, to Bhaga, to Pushan, to Tvashtar, to Brihaspati, to the king Pratyanika.
1.11.5 After they have regaled four or eight women, who are not widows, with lumps of vegetables, Sura, and food, these should perform a dance four times.
1.11.6 The same deities (they worship also) on behalf of the man,
1.11.7 And Vaisravana and Isana.
1.11.8 Then follows the distribution of food to Brahmanas.
1.12.1 The bridegroom, who has bathed and for whom auspicious ceremonies have been performed, is escorted by happy young women, who are not widows, to the girl's house.
1.12.2 To these he shall not behave unobsequiously, except where forbidden food or a transgression is concerned.
1.12.3 Having obtained their permission, he then gives her the garment with (the verse), 'The Raibhi was' (Rig-veda X, 85, 6).
1.12.4 With (the verse), 'Mind was the cushion' (ibid. 7) he takes up the salve-box.
1.12.5 [*5]. The verse for the Anointing is, 'May the Visve devas anoint (or, unite),' (ibid. 47.)
1.12.6 [*6]. 'As this (has protected) Saki the beloved one, and Aditi the mother of noble sons, and Apala who was free from widowhood, nay it thus here protect thee, N.N.!'--with these words (the. bridegroom) gives her into her right hand the quill of a porcupine (and) a string of three twisted threads,
1.12.7 With the verse, 'Shape by shape' (Rig-veda VI, 47, 18) a mirror into the left.
1.12.8 Her relations tie (to her body) a red and black, woollen or linen cord with three (amulet) gems, with the verse, 'Dark-blue and red' (Rig. veda X, 85, 28).
1.12.9 With the verse, 'Full of honey the herbs' (Rig-veda IV, 57, 3), (the bridegroom) ties (to her body) Madhuka flowers.
1.12.10 [*10]. At the wedding one cow, when the Argha ceremony has been performed; in the house one cow: these are the two Madhuparka cows.
1.12.11 [*11]. (The bridegroom) makes the girl sit down behind the fire, and while she takes hold of him he makes three oblations with the Mahavyahritis.
1.12.12 A fourth (oblation) with (the three Mahavyahritis) together is to be understood from this rule.
1.12.13 In this way, where no express rule is stated, in all sacrifices that procure happiness, one is to sacrifice before and afterwards with these same (Mahavyahritis).
1.13.1 'Be queen with thy father-in-law,' with this verse (Rig-veda X, 85, 46) her father or brother sacrifices with a sword's point on her head, or with the Sruva, standing while she is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while her face is turned to the east.
1.13.2 'I seize thy hand for the sake of happiness' (Rig-veda X, 85, 36), with these words (the bridegroom) seizes with his right hand her right hand with the thumb, both hands being turned with the palms upwards, he standing while she is sitting, with his face turned to the west, while her face is turned to the east.
1.13.3 And when he has murmured the following five verses,
1.13.4 [*4]. (He continues thus,) 'This am I, that art thou; that art thou, this am I; the heaven I, the earth thou; the Rik art thou, the Saman I. So be thou devoted to me. 'Well! Let us here marry. Let us beget offspring. Let us acquire many sons who may reach old age.'
1.13.5 (The Akarya) fills, with the words bhur bhuvah svah, a new water-pot,
1.13.6 [*6]. Throws into it (branches) with milky sap and leaves, of a tree the name of which is masculine, together with Kusa grass,
1.13.7 And gold, according to some (teachers),
1.13.8 And hands it over to a student who observes silence.
1.13.9 [*9]. They should walk round this Stheya water, (placed) to the north-east, so that they turn their right sides . towards it.
1.13.10 And after (the Akarya) has placed a stone towards the northern direction,
1.13.11 (The bridegroom) makes her rise with the words, 'Come, thou joyful one,'
1.13.12 And makes her tread with the tip of her right foot on the stone, with the words, 'Come, tread on the stone; like a stone be firm. Tread the foes down; overcome the enemies.'
1.13.13 He then leads her round the fire so that their right sides are turned to it,
1.13.14 And gives her a second garment with the same text (chap. 12,  section 3).
1.13.15 Her father or brother pours out of a basket fried grain mixed with Sami leaves into her joined hands.
1.13.16 The spreading under, the sprinkling over, and the second sprinkling over (are done) with Agya.
1.13.17 [*17]. She sacrifices those (fried grains).
1.14.1 'This woman, strewing grains, prays thus, "May I bring bliss to my relations; may my husband live long. Svaha!"'--while the husband murmurs (this) text, she sacrifices standing.
1.14.2 [*2]. (All the ceremonies,) beginning from the treading upon the stone, (are repeated) in the same way for a second time,
1.14.3 And in the same way a third time.
1.14.4 Silently, if they like, a fourth time.
1.14.5 [*5]. (The Akarya?) makes (them) step forward in a north-eastern direction seven steps (with the words),
1.14.6 'For sap with one step, for juice with two steps, for the prospering of wealth with three steps, for comfort with four steps, for cattle with five steps, for the seasons with six steps. Friend be with seven steps.'
1.14.7 (The Akarya?) 'appeases' those (foot-steps) with water.
1.14.8 [*8]. With the three Apohishthiya verses (Rig-veda X, 9, 1-3) he wipes (them) with the Stheya water,
1.14.9 [*9]. And sprinkles it on their heads.
1.14.10 (The bridegroom then) says, 'I give you a cow.'
1.14.11 Let him give something to the Brahmanas each time at the Sthalipakas and other rites;
1.14.12 [*12]. To him who knows the Surya hymn the bride's shift.
1.14.13 [*13-15]. A cow is the optional gift to be given by a Brahmana,
1.14.14 A village by a Raganya,
1.14.15 A horse by a Vaisya.
1.14.16 [*16]. A hundred (cows) with a chariot (he gives to a father) who has only daughters.
1.14.17 To those versed in the sacrificial rites he gives a horse.
1.15.1 The three verses, 'I loosen thee' (Rig-veda X, 85, 24), when she departs from the house.
1.15.2 'The living one they bewail' (Rig-veda X, 40, 10), if she begins to cry.
1.15.3 [*3]. The wife then smears the axle of the chariot with clarified butter with this (verse), 'They feasted, they got drunk' (Rig-veda I, 82, 2),
1.15.4 And with the two (verses), 'Pure are thy wheels,' 'Thy two wheels' (Rig-veda X, 85, 12. 16), of the two wheels the first with the first (verse) and the second with the second (verse),
1.15.5 And the two bulls.
1.15.6 [*6]. After (the wife?) has put, with this (verse), 'In the box of the wheel' (Rig-veda VIII, 80, 7), a branch of a fruit-bearing tree into each of the holes destined for the pins,
1.15.7 Or, if (such branches) are (already) fixed, has recited (that verse) over them,
1.15.8 They then harness the two bulls with the two (verses), 'Harnessed be thy right one' (Rig-veda I, 82, 5-6), (the bridegroom) reciting the half-verse, 'White the two bulls' (Rig-veda X, 85, 10), over them when they have been harnessed.
1.15.9 Now should any part of the chariot break or burst, let him take the girl to the house of one who keeps the sacred fires,
1.15.10 And repair (the damage) with the verse, 'Cover thyself with the Khadiras' (Rig-veda III, 53, 19).
1.15.11 A knot with the verse, 'Him like a horse' (Rig-veda X, 143, 2).
1.15.12 He then murmurs the five verses, 'May prosperity give us' (Rig-veda V, 51, 11-15).
1.15.13 'Adorned with Kimsuka flowers' (Rig-veda X, 85, 20), when she mounts the chariot;
1.15.14 'May no waylayers meet us' (ibid. 32), at a cross-way;
1.15.15 'Which the woman's' (ibid. 31), near a cemetery;
1.15.16 The half-verse, 'O tree with thy hundred branches' (Rig-veda III, 8, 11), he mutters near a big tree;
1.15.17 'The good protectress' (Rig-Veda X, 63, 10), when she ascends a ship;
1.15.18 'Carrying stones' (Rig-veda X, 53, 8), when she crosses a river;
1.15.19 Optionally (he) also (murmurs the same verse, if that is done) with the harnessed chariot;
1.15.20 'Up may your wave' (Rig-veda III, 33, 13), at deep places (in the river);
1.15.21 And (at such places) let her not look out.
1.15.22 The seven verses, 'Here may delight' (Rig-veda X, 85, 27 seq.), when she has reached the house, omitting the verses already employed.
1.16.1 [*1]. 'A bull's hide'--this has been declared.
1.16.2 [*2]. On that hide the husband makes her sit down and sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, four oblations (with the following formulas),

'Give birth to a male child; may after him (another) male be born; their mother shalt thou be, of the born, and (to others) mayst thou give birth. 'In the male verily, in the man dwells the sperm; he shall pour it forth into the woman: thus has said Dhatar, thus Pragapati has said. 'Pragapati has created him, Savitar has shaped him. Imparting birth of females to other (women) may he put here a man. 'From the auspicious sperms which the men produce for us, produce thou a son; be a well-breeding cow. 'Roar, be strong, put into her an embryo, achieve it; a male, thou male, put into her; to generation we call thee. 'Open thy womb; take in the man's sperm; may a male child be begotten in the womb.

2.2.11 [*11]. And seizing (the student's) hands with (his own) hands, holding the right uppermost, he murmurs,

2.6.1 [*1-2]. 'Waters are ye by name; happy ones are ye by name; sappy ones are ye by name; undecaying ones are ye by name; fearless ones are ye by name; immortal ones are ye by name. Of you, being such, may I partake; receive me into your favour'--with these words (the teacher) makes the student sip water three times,

2.6.7 [*7]. Having announced the alms to his teacher, he may eat (the food himself) with the master's permission.
2.6.8 The daily putting on of fuel, the going for alms, the sleeping on the ground, and obedience to the teacher: these are the standing duties of a student.
2.7.1 [*1]. Now (follows the exposition) of the study of the Veda.
2.7.2 [*2]. Both sit down to the north of the fire,
2.7.3 The teacher with his face to the east, the other one to the west.
2.7.4 [*4]. After (the student) has reverentially saluted the teacher's feet and has sprinkled his (own) hands (with water),
2.7.5 And has kneeled down with his right knee on young Kusa shoots at their roots,
2.7.6 [*6]. And has grasped round (those Kusa shoots) in 'heir middle with his hands, holding the right uppermost,
2.7.7 The teacher, having seized them at their tops with his left hand, and with his right hand sprinkling them with water, then makes the other say:
2.7.8 [*8]. 'Recite the Savitri, sir!' says the other.
2.7.9 'I recite the Savitri to thee!' says the teacher.
2.7.10 [*10]. 'Recite the Gayatri, sir!' says the other. 'I recite the Gayatri to thee!' says the teacher.
2.7.11 'Recite the verse of Visvamitra, sir!' says the other. 'I recite the verse of Visvamitra to thee!' says the teacher.
2.7.12 'Recite the Rishis, sir!' says the other. I recite the Rishis to thee!' says the teacher.
2.7.13 'Recite the deities, sir!' says the other. 'I recite the deities to thee!' says the teacher.
2.7.14 'Recite the metres, sir!' says the other. 'I recite the metres to thee!' says the teacher.
2.7.15 'Recite the Sruti, sir!' says the other. 'I recite the Sruti to thee!' says the teacher.
2.7.16 'Recite the Smriti, sir!' says the other. 'I recite the Smriti to thee!' says the teacher.
2.7.17 [*17]. 'Recite faith and insight, sir!' says the other. 'I recite faith and insight to thee!' says the teacher.
2.7.18 [*18-20]. In that way, according to what Rishi each hymn belongs to and what its deity and its metre is, thus (with the corresponding indications of Rishi, &c.) let him recite each hymn;
2.7.19 [*19]. Or also, if he does not know the Rishis, deities, and metres, the teacher recites this verse, 'That glorious (splendour) of Savitar' (Rig-veda III, 62, 10), pada by pada, hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) without a stop, and says, when he has finished, 'This (verse belongs to Savitar; it is a Gayatri; Visvamitra is its Rishi).'
2.7.20 Let him thus recite (the hymns belonging to) each Rishi, or (each) Anuvaka;
2.7.21 [*21]. Of the short hymns (in the tenth Mandala) an Anuvaka,
2.7.22 Or as much as the master may think fit.
2.7.23 Or optionally he may recite the first and last hymn of (each) Rishi,
2.7.24 [*24]. Or of (each) Anuvaka,
2.7.25 (Or) one (verse) of the beginning of each hymn.
2.7.26 The teacher may optionally say at the beginning of the hymn, 'This is the commencement.'
2.7.27 [*27]. This has been (further) explained in (the treatise about) the Rishisvadhyaya.
2.7.28 [*28]. When (the lesson) is finished, he takes the young Kusa shoots, makes of cow-dung a pit at their roots, and sprinkles water on the Kusa (shoots) for each hymn.
2.7.29 [*29]. For the rest of the day standing and fasting.
2.8.1 [*1]. In the afternoon, having obtained by begging fried barley grains, he shall sacrifice them with his hand on the fire according to the rites of the Agya oblations with the text, 'The lord of the seat, the wonderful' (Rig-veda I, 18, 6 seq.), verse by verse, down to the end of the hymn,
2.8.2 [*8_2]. Causing the teacher by (the gift of) food to pronounce auspicious wishes.
2.9.1 [*9_1]. In the forest, with a piece of wood in his hand, seated, he performs the Sandhya (or twilight devotion) constantly, observing silence, turning his face north-west, to the region between the chief (west) point and the intermediate (north-western) point (of the horizon), until the stars appear,
2.9.2 [*9_2]. Murmuring, when (the twilight) has passed, the Mahavyahritis, the Savitri, and the auspicious hymns.
2.9.3 In the same way in the morning, turning his face to the east, standing, until the disk of the sun appears.
2.10.1 [*10_1]. When (the sun) has risen, the study (of the Veda) goes on.
2.10.2 Every day in the evening and in the morning,
2.10.3 He establishes the fire (in its proper place), wipes (with his hand the ground) round (it), sprinkles (water) round (it), bends his right knee,
2.10.4 [*4]. (And puts fuel on the fire with the texts,) 'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood, to the great Gatavedas; may he, Gatavedas, give faith and insight to me. Svaha! 'Firewood art thou; may we prosper. Fuel art thou; splendour art thou; put splendour into me. Svaha! 'Being inflamed make me prosperous in offspring and wealth. Svaha! Thine is this fuel, Agni; thereby thou shalt grow and gain vigour. And may we grow and gain vigour. Svaha!'
2.10.5 Having then sprinkled (water) round (the fire),
2.10.6 He approaches the fire with the verse, 'May Agni (vouchsafe) to me faith and insight, not-forgetting (what I have learned) and memory; may this praiseful Gatavedas give blessing to us.'
2.10.7 [*7]. He makes with ashes the tripundhra sign (the sign of three strokes) which is set forth in the (treatise on the) Sauparnavrata, which is revealed, which agrees with the tradition handed down by the ancients, with the five formulas 'The threefold age' (see above, I, 28, 9), one by one, on five (places), viz. the forehead, the heart, the right shoulder and the left, and then on the back.]
2.10.8 He who approaches the fire after having sacrificed thus, studies of these Vedas, one, two, three, or all.
2.11.1 [*1]. Now (follows) the directing to the (special) observances.
2.11.2 [*2-4]. The rules for it have been explained by the initiation.
2.11.3 He does not recite the Savitri.
2.11.4 [*4]. Some say that the handing over of the staff forms the end (of this ceremony).
2.11.5 During the northern course of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon--
2.11.6 [*6]. The teacher having abstained through one day and one night, from sexual intercourse and from eating flesh--
2.11.7 [*7]. With the exclusion of the fourteenth day and of the eighth (of the half-month),
2.11.8 And of the first and last, according to some (teachers),
2.11.9 [*9]. Or on what day else the constellation seems lucky to him, on that day he shall direct (the student) to the duties of holiness according to the Sukriya rite.
2.11.10 [*10]. Let him observe (those) duties through three days, or twelve days, or one year, or as long as the master may think fit.
2.11.11 The Sakvara (observance), however, (is to be kept) one year.
2.11.12 (So also) the Vratika and Aupanishada (observances).
2.11.13 [*13]. When the time has elapsed, when the duties have been observed, when the Veda has been studied down to the Samyu-Barhaspatya-(hymn), let (the teacher then), should he intend to instruct (the student) in the secret (part of the Veda), ascertain the time (through which the student has to observe the special rites) and the rules to be observed, from the (special) directions (that are handed down on this subject).
2.12.1 [*1]. After (the student) has eaten something in the morning, in the afternoon, to the north-east--
2.12.2 Having sacrificed, the teacher then asks him with regard to those deities to whom he has been given in charge (see above, chap. 3, 1), 'Hast thou fulfilled the duties of holiness before Agni, Indra, the Sun, and the Visve devas?'
2.12.3 If he answers, 'I have fulfilled them, sir!'--
2.12.4 The teacher three times envelops, from the left to the right, with a fresh garment the face (of the student) who is standing behind the fire, in front of the teacher, with his face to the east.
2.12.5 [*5]. He turns the skirt (of that garment) upwards so that it cannot slip down,
2.12.6 [*6]. (And says) 'Leaving off for three days the putting on of fuel, the going for alms, the sleeping on the ground, and the obedience to the teacher, fast in the forest, in a god's house or in a place where Agnihotra is performed, keeping silence, with earnest care.'
2.12.7 Here some (teachers) prescribe the same observances only for one night, during which he is to stand.
2.12.8 [*8]. The teacher refrains from eating flesh and from sexual intercourse.
2.12.9 When those three days or that night has elapsed, going out from the village he shall avoid to look at the following (persons or things) that form impediments for the study (of the Veda):
2.12.10 [*10]. Raw flesh, a Kandala, a woman that has lately been confined, or that has her courses, blood, persons whose hands have been cut off, cemeteries, and all sorts of corpse-like (animals?) which enter (their dens?) with the mouth first (?), keeping them away from the place where he dwells.
2.12.11 Going out (from the village) in a north-eastern direction the teacher sits down on a clean spot. turning his face to the east.
2.12.12 [*12]. When the sun has risen, he recites, in the way prescribed for the Veda-study, (the Aranyaka texts to the student) who is to keep silence and who wears a turban.
2.12.13 [*13]. This rule is to be observed only for the Mahanamni verses.
2.12.14 At the sections however that follow (after the Mahanamnis) the other one hears while the teacher recites them for himself.
2.12.15 He gives (to the teacher) the turban, a vessel, a good cow.
2.12.16 (The teacher accepts the gifts) with the verses, 'Thou him' (Rig-veda I, 18, 5), and, 'High in the sky' (Rig-veda X, 107, 2), or (he accepts them) all with the Pranava (i.e. the syllable Om).
2.12.17 Here some prepare a mess of rice for the Visve devas at all sections (of the Aranyaka);
2.12.18 [*18]. For the gods to whom he has been given in charge, according to Mandukeya.
2.13.1 Now (follow) the rules regarding the staff.
2.13.2 Let him not leave a passage between himself and the staff.
2.13.3 [*3]. Now should any one of these things, viz. staff, girdle, or sacrificial cord, break or rend, the same penance (takes place) therefore which (has been prescribed) at the wedding with regard to the chariot.
2.13.4 If the girdle cannot be repaired, he makes another and speaks over it (the following verses):
2.13.5 'Thou who knowest the distinction of pure and impure, divine protectress Sarasvati, O girdle, prolong my vow unimpaired, unbroken. 'Thou, Agni, art the pure bearer of vows. Agni, carry hither the gods to our sacrifice and our oblation. 'Bearing the vows, the infallible protector of vows, be our messenger, undecaying and mighty. Giving treasures, merciful, Agni, protect us, that we may live, Gatavedas!
2.13.6 And he ties the sacrificial cord to the staff.
2.13.7 Here it is said also:
2.13.8 [*8]. 'Let him sacrifice the sacrificial cord and the staff, the girdle and also the skin in water after the completion of his vow with a Varuna-verse or with the essence (of the Vedas, i.e. the syllable Om).
2.14.1 [*1]. Now (follows) the Vaisvadeva (sacrifice).
2.14.2 [*2]. The rite of the sacrifice has been explained.
2.14.3 Let him pour oblations of prepared Vaisvadeva food in the evening and in the morning into the (sacred) domestic fire.
2.14.4 'To Agni svaha! To Soma svaha! To Indra and Agni svaha! To Vishnu svaha! To Bharadvaga Dhanvantari svaha! To the Visve devas svaha! To Pragapati svaha! To Aditi svaha! To Anumati svaha! To Agni Svishtakrit svaha!'--having thus offered the oblations belonging to those deities,
2.14.5 He then shall offer Balis (i.e. portions of food) in the centre of the floor to the same deities; (then another Bali with the words,) 'Adoration to Brahman and to the Brahmanas!' and (with the verse), 'Vastoshpati, accept us' (Rig-veda VII, 54, 1) in the centre of the floor to Vastoshpati.
2.14.6 [*6-7]. He then distributes Balis, from the left to the right, through the different quarters (of the horizon, to the presiding deities) in due order (with the words),
2.14.7 'Adoration to Indra and to those belonging to Indra! Adoration to Yama and to those belonging to Yama! Adoration to Varuna and to those belonging to Varuna! Adoration to Soma and to those belonging to Soma! Adoration to Brihaspati and to those belonging to Brihaspati!'
2.14.8 [*8]. Then (turned) towards the disk of the sun, 'Adoration to Aditi and to the Adityas! Adoration to the Nakshatras, to seasons, to months, to half-months, to days and nights, to years!'
2.14.9 'To Pushan, the path-maker; to Dhatar, to Vidhatar, and to the Maruts'--(thus) on the thresholds.
2.14.10 To Vishnu on the grindstone.
2.14.11 'To the tree'--(thus) in the mortar.
2.14.12 'To the herbs'--(thus) where the herbs are kept.
2.14.13 'To Parganya, to the waters'--(thus) near the water-pot.
2.14.14 'Adoration to Sri'--(thus) in the bed at the head, 'to Bhadrakali at the foot.
2.14.15 In the privy, 'Adoration to Sarvannabhuti!'
2.14.16 Then (he throws a Bali) into the air, in the evening with the words, 'To the night-walkers,' in the morning with the words, 'To the day-walkers,' and with the Verse,' Which gods' (Rig-veda I, 139, 11).
2.14.17 To the unknown deities to the north, and to Dhanapati (i.e. the Lord of treasures).
2.14.18 With the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder he pours out the remnant to the south with the verse, 'They whom the fire has burnt' (Rig-veda X, 15, 14).
2.14.19 When he has made his offerings to gods, fathers (i.e. Manes), and men, let him give food to a Srotriya (i.e. to a learned Brahmana).
2.14.20 Or let him give alms (of food) to a student.
2.14.21 [*21]. Let him immediately afterwards offer food to a female under his protection, to a pregnant woman, to boys, and to old people.
2.14.22 [*22-23]. Let him throw (some food) on the ground for the dogs, for the dog-butchers, and for the birds.
2.14.23 [*23]. Let him eat nothing without having cut off (and offered as a Bali) a portion thereof.
2.14.24 (Let him) not (eat) alone,
2.14.25 Nor before (the others).
2.14.26 With regard thereto it has been said also in the Rik,' In vain the fool gains food' (Rig-veda X, 117, 6).
2.15.1 [*1]. Should any one of the six persons (mentioned in the Srauta-sutra and in the Sutras 4-9) to whom the Arghya reception is due, visit (him), let him make (ready) a cow, a goat, or what (sort of food) he thinks most like (thereto).
2.15.2 [*2-3]. Let the Argha not be without flesh.
2.15.3 On the occasion of a sacrifice and of a wedding let (the guest) say, 'Make it (ready).'
2.15.4 The animal (offered) to the teacher is sacred to Agni;
2.15.5 If offered to an officiating priest, to Brihaspati;
2.15.6 [*6]. If to the father-in-law, to Pragapati;
2.15.7 If to a king, to Indra;
2.15.8 [*8]. If to a friend, to Mitra;
2.15.9 If to a Snataka, to Indra and Agni;
2.15.10 Even if he performs more than one Soma sacrifice during a year, let only priests who have received (from him) the Arghya reception officiate for him, not such who have not received it.
2.15.11 [*11]. Here it is said also: Samanyatamam sadrisatamam mashadikam (makhadikam the MS.) annam. Narayana.
2.16.1 'At the Madhuparka and at the Soma sacrifice, at the sacred rites for fathers (Manes) and gods only animals may be killed, not elsewhere: thus has Manu said.
2.16.2 'Both his teacher and his father, and also a friend who does not stay in his house as a guest: whatever these dispose, that let him do; such is the established custom.
2.16.3 [*3]. 'Let him not consider as a guest a person living in the same village, or one that comes in returning from a journey; (but let him consider as a guest only) one who has arrived at his house where the wife or the fires (of the host) are.
2.16.4 [*4]. '(The fire of) the Agnihotra, bulls, and a guest that has come in at the right time, children and persons of noble families: these burn up him who neglects them.
2.16.5 'A bull, the Agnihotra, and a student, these three prosper only if they eat; there is no prosperity for them, if they do not eat.
2.16.6 'Day by day the domestic deities approach the man who performs the domestic rites, in order to receive their share; (that) let him pour out to them.
2.17.1 'Even if a man constantly gather grass and perform the Agnihotra, a Brahmana who stays (in his house) without receiving honour takes away all his good works.
2.17.2 'One should give (even) if it were only a water-pot; one should sacrifice (even) if it were a piece of wood; (even) down to one hymn or to one Anuvaka the Brahmayagna is enjoined.
2.17.3 'When on a journey let him not fast; (during that time) the wife keeps the vow. Let his son, his brother, or his wife, or his pupil offer the Bali oblation.
2.17.4 'Those who perform this Vaisvadeva sacrifice in the evening and in the morning, they will prosper in wealth and (long) life, in fame and offspring.'
2.18.1 A student who is going to set out on a journey, speaks thus to his teacher:
2.18.2 [*2]. 'Of inhalation and exhalation'--(this he says) in a low voice; 'Om, I will dwell'--this aloud.
2.18.3 (The teacher) in a low voice (replies), 'To inhalation and exhalation I, the wide-extended one, resort with thee. To the protecting god I give thee in charge. God Savitar; this student belongs to thee; I give him in charge to thee; protect him; do not forsake him.'
2.18.4 'Om, hail!' the teacher aloud. 'Hail!' the teacher aloud.
3.1.1 A bath (shall be taken by the student) when he is going to return home (from his teacher).

3.1.7 He then puts on him a golden ornament (with the words), 'Giving life and vigour' (Vagasaneyi Samhita XXXIV, 50).
3.1.8 With (the verse), 'Mine, Agni, be vigour' (Rig-veda X, 128, 1), the veiling (of the head is done).

3.1.15 Or let him return (making his start) from cows or from a fruit-bearing tree.
3.1.16 With (the verses), 'Indra, give us best goods,' and, 'Be friendly, O earth' (Rig-veda II, 21, 6; I, 22, 15) he descends (from the chariot).
3.1.17 Let him eat that day his favourite food.
3.1.18 [*18]. To his teacher he shall give (that) pair of garments, the turban, ear-rings and jewel, staff and shoes, and the parasol.
3.2.1 [*1]. If he wishes to have a house built, he draws with an Udumbara branch three times a line round (the building-ground) with (the words), 'Here I include the dwellings for the sake of food,' and sacrifices in (its) centre on an elevated spot,
3.2.2 (With the texts,) 'Who art thou? Whose art thou? To whom do I sacrifice thee, desirous of (dwelling in the) village? Svaha! 'Thou art the gods' share on this (earth). From here have sprung the fathers who have passed away. The ruler has sacrificed, desirous of (dwelling in the) village, not omitting anything that belongs to the gods. Svaha!'
3.2.3 Having had the pits for the posts dug,
3.2.4 He pours water-gruel into them,
3.2.5 And with (the verse), 'This branch of the immortal one I erect, a stream of honey, promoting wealth. The child, the young one, cries to it; the cow shall low to it, the unceasingly fertile one'--he puts an Udumbara branch which has been besmeared with ghee into the pit for the right door-post.
3.2.6 'This branch of the world I establish, a stream of honey, promoting wealth. The child, the young one, cries to it; the cow shall low to it that has a young calf'--thus to the left.
3.2.7 In the same way at the two (pits) to the south, to the west, and to the north.
3.2.8 With (the verse), 'This branch of this tree, that drops ghee, I erect in the immortal. The child, the young one, cries to it; cows shall flock to it, unceasingly fertile ones'--he erects the chief post.
3.2.9 [*9]. 'May the young child come to it, may the calf . . . .; may they come to it with a cup of Parisrut, with pots of curds.
3.3.1 [*1]. 'Stand here, O post, firm, rich in horses and cows, . . . .; stand safely, dropping ghee; stand here, fixed in the ground, prosperous, long-lasting(?), amid the prosperity of people who satiate themselves. May the malevolent ones not reach thee! 'Hither are called the cows; hither are called goats and sheep; and the sweet essence (?) of food is called hither to our house. 'Stand fast in the Rathantara; recline on the Vamadevya; establish thyself on the Brihat'--with (these texts) he touches the chief post.
3.3.2 When the house has been built conformably (to its proper dimensions), he touches the posts.
3.3.3 The two (posts) to the east with (the words), 'Truth and faith!'
3.3.4 Those to the south with (the words), 'Sacrifice and gift!'

3.3.9 'The year the roof!'
3.3.10 With (the verse), 'A bull, an ocean' (Rig-veda V, 47, 3)' let him bury an anointed stone under the pinnacle.
3.4.1 [*1]. At the sacrifice to Vastoshpati--
3.4.2 [*2]. Having established the (sacred) domestic fire outside with (the words), 'I place (here) Agni with genial mind; may he be the assembler of goods. Do no harm to us, to the old nor to the young; be a saviour to us, to men and animals!'--
3.4.3 Having put a new water-pot on fresh eastward-pointed Kusa-grass,
3.4.4 And spoken over it (the words), 'Unhurt be our men, may our riches not be squandered!'--
3.4.5 [*5-7]. He sacrifices three oblations in the forenoon with the Stotriya text of the Rathantara with repetition and Kakubh-forming;

3.4.9 Taking with himself his eldest son and his wife, carrying grain, let him enter (the house with the words), 'Indra's house is blessed, wealthy, protecting; that I enter with my wife, with offspring, with cattle, with increase of wealth, with everything that is mine.'
3.5.1 'To every able one, to every blissful one, to you I turn for the sake of safety, of peace. Free from danger may we be. May the village give me in charge to the forest. All! give me in charge to the great one,'--thus (he speaks) when leaving the village.
3.5.2 'May the forest give me in charge to the village. Great one! give me in charge to the all'--thus (he speaks) when entering the village, not without (carrying) something (with himself, such as fuel, flowers, &c.)
3.5.3 [*3]. I enter the blessed, joyful house, which does not bring death to men; manly (I enter) that which is rich in men. Bringing refreshment, dropping ghee (we enter the house) in which I shall joyfully rest'--this verse is constantly to be pronounced (when he enters the house).
3.6.1 One who has not set up the (sacred Srauta) fires, when setting out on a journey, looks at his house.
3.6.2 (He murmurs the text,) 'Do ye both, Mitra and Varuna, protect this house for me; unscathed, undisturbed, may Pushan guard it till our return;'
3.6.3 And murmurs (the verse), 'Upon the path we have entered' (Rig-veda VI, 51, 16).
3.7.1 When he then returns from his journey, he looks at his house (and says),
3.7.2 [*2]. 'House, do not fear, do not tremble; bringing strength we come back. Bringing strength, joyful and wise, I come back to thee, to the house, rejoicing in my mind. 'That of which the traveller thinks, that in which dwells much joy, that I call the house. May it know us as we know it. 'Hither are called the cows; hither are called goats and sheep; and the sweet essence (?) of food is called hither to our house.'
3.7.3 Having approached the (sacred) domestic fire with the verse, 'This Agni is glorious to us, this is highly glorious. Worshipping him (?) may we suffer no harm; may he bring us to supremity'--
3.7.4 Let him pronounce auspicious words.
3.7.5 [*5]. When accepting the water for washing the feet he says, 'The milk of Virag art thou; may I obtain the milk of Virag; in me (may) the milk of Padya Virag (dwell)!'
3.8.1 [*1]. When one who has not set up the (sacred Srauta) fires, is going to partake of the first-fruits (of the harvest), let him sacrifice to the Agrayana deities with (Agni) Svishtakrit as the fourth, and with the word SVAHA, on his (sacred) domestic fire.
3.8.2 Having recited over (the food) which he is going to eat (the formula), 'To Pragapati I draw thee, the proper portion, for luck to me, for glory to me, for food to me!'--
3.8.3 [*3]. He thrice eats of it, sprinkling it with water, with (the verse), 'From the good you have led us to the better, ye gods! Through thee, the nourishment, may we obtain thee. Thus enter into us, O potion, bringing refreshment; be a saviour to us, to men and animals!'
3.8.4 With (the verse), 'This art thou, breath; the truth I speak This art thou; from all directions thou hast entered (into all beings). Thou driving away old age and sickness from my body be at home with me. Do not forsake us, Indra!'--he touches the place of the heart;

May the entire share, O cows, that belongs to this lord of cows, suffer no harm among you--(and) 'May Pushan go after our cows' (Rig-veda VI, 54, 5)--this he shall speak over the cows when they go away (to their pasture-grounds).
3.9.2 'May Pushan hold' (Rig-veda VI, 54, 10), when they run about.
3.9.3 'May they whose udder with its four holes is full of sweet and ghee, be milk-givers to us; (may they be) many in our stable, rich in ghee'--and, 'The cows have come' (Rig-veda VI, 28), when they have come back.

3.11.3 He sacrifices, after having kindled amid the cows a well-inflamed fire, Agya oblations (with the words),
3.11.4 Here is delight; take delight here. Svaha! Here is still-standing; here is (your) own still-standing. Svaha! 'I have let the calf join its mother. May the calf, sucking its mother's breast, support increase of wealth among us. Svaha!'
3.11.5 With the verse, 'May Pushan go after our cows' (Rig-veda VI, 54, 5) he sacrifices from (a mess of sacrificial food) belonging to Pushan.

3.11.8 Or one that protects the herd,
3.11.9 Or that is protected by the herd,
3.11.10 Or it may also be red.
3.11.11 It should have all its limbs complete, and be the finest (bull) in the herd.
3.11.12 Having adorned that (bull),
3.11.13 And the four best young cows of the herd, having adorned those too,
3.11.14 [*14]. (He says,) 'This young (bull) I give you as your husband; sporting with him, your lover, walk about. Do not desert us (?), being joined (with us) from your birth. In increase of wealth, in food may we rejoice. Svaha!'

3.11.16 With the milk of all of them he shall cook milk-rice and feed Brahmanas with it.
3.12.1 [*1]. After the Agrahayani (or the full moon day of the month Margasirsha) (follow) the three Ashtakas in the second fortnight (of the Margasirsha and of the two following months).
3.12.2 At the first of these he sacrifices vegetables,
3.12.3 [*3]. With (the verse), 'She who shone forth first is this (earth); she walks, having entered into this (earth). The wife has brought forth (children), the new-creating mother. May the three powers follow her. Svaha!'
3.12.4 Now (the oblation for Agni) Svishtakrit,
3.12.5 [*5]. With (the verses), 'She in whom Yama, the son of Vivasvat, and all gods are contained, the Ashtaka whose face is turned to all sides, she has satiated my desires.

3.13.1 [*1]. At the middle (Ashtaka) and in the middle of the rainy season,

3.13.3 Or (he shall do so) with the verse, 'Carry the omentum, Gatavedas, to the Manes, where thou knowest them in the world of virtue. May streams of fat flow to them; may the wishes of the sacrificer be fulfilled. Svaha!'
3.13.4 (Then follow) the four Mahavyahritis (and) the four (verses), 'They who have thirsted' (see Sutra 2): (thus is offered) an eightfold oblation of cooked food, together with the cut-off portions.
3.13.5 [*5]. Or, 'Interposed are the mountains; interposed is the wide earth to me. With the sky and all the points of the horizon I interpose another one instead of the father. To N.N. svaha! 'Interposed to me are the seasons, and days and nights, the twilight's children. With the months and half-months I interpose another one instead of the father. To N.N. svaha! 'With the standing ones, with the streaming ones. with the small ones that flow about: with the waters, the supporters of all I interpose another one instead of the father. To N.N. svaha! 'Wherein my mother has done amiss, going astray, faithless to her husband, that sperm may my father take as his own; may another one fall off from the mother. To N.N. svaha!'--these four (verses) instead of the Mahavyahritis, if (the sacrificer) is an illegitimate child.
3.13.6 Or milk-rice (should be offered).

3.14.4 Or he may optionally offer food to a cow.
3.14.5 [*5]. Or he may optionally burn down brushwood in the forest and say, 'This is my Ashtaka.'
3.14.6 But let him not neglect to do (one of these things). But let him not neglect to do (one of these things).
4.1.1 [*1]. Let him offer (Sraddha oblations) every month to the fathers.
4.1.2 [*2]. Having invited an uneven number of Brahmanas, versed in the Veda, at least three, to sit down as (representing) the fathers,
4.1.3 And having strewn sesamum into an uneven number of water-pots,
4.1.4 He shall pour them out over the hands of the Brahmanas, assigning (this gift) to them with the words, 'N.N.! This to thee!'
4.1.5 [*5-7]. After this they should be adorned;
4.1.6 And after he has (respectfully) spoken to them, and has put food into the fire,
4.1.7 Assigning (the food) to them with the words, 'N.N.! This to thee!' he shall cause them to eat.
4.1.8 While they are eating, he shall murmur the Mahavyahritis, the Savitri, the Madhuvatiya-verses (Rig-veda I, 90, 6 seq.), and verses addressed to the Manes and to (Soma) Pavamana.
4.1.9 [*9]. When they have finished with eating, he shall offer the lumps (of flour).
4.1.10 [*10-11]. Before (their dinner he shall offer) the lumps, according to some (teachers).
4.1.11 Behind (these he places the lumps) for their wives, putting something between (these and the preceding ones).
4.1.12 To the Brahmanas he shall announce the remnants.
4.1.13 [*13]. The rites of the putting (of food) into the fire (see Sutra 6), &c. have been declared (in the Srauta-sutra) by the Pindapitriyagna.
4.2.1 [*1] Now (follows) the Ekoddishta (i.e. the Sraddha ceremony directed to a single dead person),
4.2.2 With one strainer,
4.2.3 [*3]. One (pot of) Argha-water,
4.2.4 One lump (of flour).
4.2.5 [*5]. No inviting (takes place here), nor the putting (of food) into the fire, nor (do) the Visve devas (take part in this ceremony). 'Relished?'--thus are they to be asked whether they are satiated. 'May it approach (the fathers),' instead of 'imperishable.'
4.2.6 'Be satisfied,' when sending them away.
4.2.7 Thus through one year, when one has died.
4.2.8 [*8]. And (then) omission of the fourth one.
4.3.1 [*1]. Now (follows) the Sapindikarana (i.e. reception of a dead person into the community of Pinda-offerings with the other Manes).
4.3.2 [*2]. When one year has elapsed, or three half-months,

4.3.6 And pours the pot that belongs to the (newly) dead person out into the pots of the fathers with the two verses, 'They who commonly' (Vagasaneyi Samhita XIX, 45. 46).
4.3.7 Thus also the lump (of flour).
4.3.8 This is the Sapindikarana.
4.4.1 [*1]. Now (follows) the Abhyudayika (i.e. the Sraddha ceremony referring to good luck).
4.4.2 In the fortnight of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day,
4.4.3 [*3]. After the sacrifice to the mothers has been performed,
4.4.4 And an even number of (Brahmanas) versed in the Veda have been invited to sit down;
4.4.5 In the forenoon;
4.4.6 [*6]. The rite is performed from left to right.
4.4.7 [*7]. The murmuring with the omission of the verses belonging to the Manes.
4.4.8 The Darbha blades are straight.
4.4.9 [*9]. Barley is to be used instead of sesamum.
4.4.10 The lumps are mixed with curds, jujube fruits, fried grain.
4.4.11 [*11]. On inviting (the Manes, he should say), 'The Nandimukha (glad-faced?) Manes will I invite.'
4.4.12 [*12]. 'May the Nandimukha Manes be rejoiced,' instead of 'imperishable.'
4.4.13 [*13]. 'The Nandimukha Manes will I make speak,' when he makes (the Brahmanas) speak.
4.4.14 [*14]. '(Was it) well done?'--thus are they to be asked whether they are satiated.
4.4.15 The rest is the same (as in the other kinds of Sraddha rites), as far as it is not  (by contrary rules).

4.5.4 [*4]. Or with the first verses of the Suktas and Anuvakas.
4.5.5 With the first verses of the Adhyayas and of the sections belonging to the (different) Rishis, according to Mandukeya.
4.5.6 But Kaushitaki has said:
4.5.7 'I praise Agni the Purohita' (Rig-veda I, 1, 1), this one verse,
4.5.8 'The Kushumbhaka (mungoose?) has said it;' 'If thou criest, O bird, announce luck to us;' 'Sung by Gamadagni;' 'In thy abode the whole world rests;'  'Come to our sacrifice, O you that are worthy of sacrifice, with care;' 'Whosoever, be he ours, be he alien;' 'Look on, look about;' 'Come here, Agni, the Maruts' friend;' 'The oblation, O king, cooked for thee:' each time two verses,

4.5.12 Murmur the Mahavyahritis, the Savitri, and the auspicious hymns commencing from the beginning of the Veda,
4.5.13 And cause the teacher to pronounce auspicious wishes.
4.5.14 Of this (ceremony) it is also said,
4.5.15 'Desirous (of acquiring) for the hymns inexhaustible vigour, reverence, and also soundness, the Rishis, by the power of their austerities, have discovered the Upakarman.
4.5.16 [*16]. 'Therefore a constant performer of the six kinds of works should, in order that his Mantras might be successful, perform the Upakarman--so they say--if he wishes for success of his (holy) works.
4.5.17 [*17]. 'At the time of the Upakarman and of the Utsarga an interruption (of the Veda-study) shall take place for (three days and) three nights, likewise at the Ashtakas for one day and one night, and so on the last night of each season.'
4.6.1 [*1]. On the first day of the bright fortnight of Magha,

4.7.53 [*53]. (The same rules hold good,) except (those regarding) lightning, thunder, and rain, for (the study of) the Kalpa. During the five months and a half (they have to behave) as while it rains.
4.7.54 Thereof it is also said,
4.7.55 [*55]. 'Food, water, roots and fruits, and whatsoever else Sraddha-food there may be: even when he has (only) accepted thereof, the study should be interrupted; the Brahmana's hand is his mouth; so it is taught.'
4.8.1 [*1]. And to (students) who have been duly initiated he shall set forth (the Veda);

Now, after having paid reverence to Brahman, to the Brahmarishi, to (those who descend from) Brahman's womb, to Indra, Pragapati, Vasishtha, Vamadeva, Kahola Kaushitaki, Mahakaushitaki, Suyagna Sankhayana, Asvalayana, Aitareya, Mahaitareya, Katyayana, Satyayana, Sakalya, Babhru, Babhravya, Mandu, Mandavya, and to all the teachers of the past, we will henceforth explain the rules for the Aranyaka as forming the subject of Svadhyaya (private recitation of a text).
6.1.2 [*2]. The teacher abstains through one day and one night from sexual intercourse and from eating flesh.
6.1.3 [*3-5]. Raw flesh, a Kandala, a woman that has lately been confined, or that has her courses, seeing blood or persons whose hands have been cut off: (these persons and things he shall know form) impediments for the study.
6.1.4 And of the corpse-like (animals?).
6.1.5 Those which enter (their dens?) with the mouth first (?).
6.1.6 When he has vomited, or when his beard has been shaved,
6.1.7 When he has eaten flesh or partaken of a Sraddha or birth dinner,
6.1.8 During the days that immediately follow on (days of) study in the village,
6.1.9 Three nights (and days), if (he has been) put out of order,
6.1.10 (Or has been violently) seized by others,
6.1.11 And during the second half of the days that precede (?) the Parvan days,
6.1.12 And if fire-flames, lightning, thunder, (heavy) rains, and great clouds appear,
6.1.13 And if a storm (blows) that carries away pebbles, as long as that lasts.
6.2.1 During four months after the full moon of Ashadha let him not study.
6.2.2 [*2]. Especially the Sakvari verses (are concerned by what has been declared). Such are the rules.
6.2.3 [*3]. Let them go to a clean spot in the north-eastern direction, that receives its light from the east.
6.2.4 The drawing of water (should be done) before sunrise,
6.2.5 [*5]. And the entering into the circle with this verse, 'She who smells of salve' (Rig-veda X, 146, 6).
6.2.6 [*6]. The circle should have its entrance to the east or to the north; it should be (praised as) excellent among the people, not too spacious, not too narrow.
6.2.7 [*7]. The final expiation (should extend) to the Vamadevya.
6.2.8 And the invitation to resume the recitation (is done in the following way)
6.2.9 After they have sipped water that stands outside the circle,
6.2.10 Let them resume the recitation, having performed the expiation.
6.2.11 If the vessel used in the expiation is damaged, sprinkling (with water forms) the expiatory act (to be performed for it).
6.2.12 (That) sprinkling, however, (one should perform) holding gold or a bunch of Darbha grass in his hand.
6.2.13 So far what pertains to the general rules.
6.3.1 Now after they have entered the circle--
6.3.2 [*2-3]. The teacher sits down with his face to the east, the others, according to their rank, (sit down) towards the south, with their faces to the north.
6.3.3 If that is impossible, with their faces to all directions.
6.3.4 Let them expect the rising of the sun,
6.3.5 And when they behold it in its splendour,
6.3.6 [*6]. Let them with (the words), 'Recite, sir!' seize with their hands, holding the right hand uppermost, the feet of the teacher, which have been washed, with the right (hand) the right (foot), with the left the left,
6.3.7 [*7]. And having then put (the hands) into the vessel used for the expiation, into water in which pieces of Durva stalks are, let them begin their study, when their hands have ceased to drip.
6.3.8 This is the rite. But when they are tired, let one of them bring it about that the vessel used for the expiation be not empty.
6.3.9 And all (should do so) at the beginning and the end of (each) Adhyaya.
6.3.10 [*10]. (All) that is done continuously, without interruption.
6.3.11 Now the expiation.
6.3.12 [*12]. The syllable OM, the Mahavyahritis, the Savitri, the Rathantara, the Brihat, the Vamadevya; Brihat and Rathantara with repetition and Kakubh-forming.
6.3.13 [*13]. These (holy words and verses) are (thus) made to attain (the number of) ten.
6.3.14 [*14]. 'Of decades consists the Virag'--thus says the Brahmana.
6.4.1 [*1]. 'Unerring mind, vigorous eye (is) the sun, the noblest of the stars. Inauguration, do no harm to me!'--with (these words) they look at Savitri (I.e. the sun).
6.4.2 One (verse), 'You both the gladdening one' (Rig-veda X, 131, 4), and the three (verses), 'Blessing to us on the paths' (Rig-veda X, 63, 15-17) (are to be repeated before the recitation) of the Mahavrata (chapter).
6.4.3 But (at that) of the Sakvari (verses) before (the formula mentioned in the first Sara):
6.4.4 [*4]. The three Trikas, 'To him, the thirsty one' (Rig-veda VI, 42, 1-3), 'The wealthiest (Soma), O wealthy one' (VI, 44, 1-3), 'Him who does no harm to you' (VI, 44, 4-6), (the verse), 'To him, to him the sap of the herb' (VI, 42, 4), (and the verse), "Verily thou art a hero' (VIII, 81, 28)--thus for the Sakvari (verses) before and afterwards.
6.4.5 Now for the Upanishad (texts)--
6.4.6 The same (recitation) as for the Mahavrata.
6.4.7 [*7]. For the Samhitas, however, before (the text given in the first Sutra the formula has to be recited), 'I shall speak right, I shall speak truth (&c.)'--this is the difference (in the case of the Samhitas).
6.4.8 [*8]. Now for the Mantha the two verses (have to be recited) before (the formula given in the first Sutra), 'This we entreat of Savitar,' 'That glorious (splendour) of Savitar' (Rig-veda V, 82, 1; III, 62, 10).
6.4.9 With (the formula), 'Unerring mind' (see Sutra 1), then follow the expiatory formulas that belong to the (different) sections.
6.4.10 (All) this on one day.
6.4.11 [*11-12]. Now if the time for rising has come, they drive away (all) evil,
6.4.12 Perform the standing expiation,
6.4.13 And look at the sun with (the words), 'From here I take out the brightness (?).'
6.5.1 [*1]. 'That (I place) within myself'--with (these words they turn their thoughts to the universal) Self that is placed (within themselves?)three times repeated (?).
6.5.2 With (the formula), 'May happiness rejoice in me and glory; may happiness rejoice with me and glory;--
6.5.3 'Together with Indra, with the hosts, with power, with glory, with strength I will rise'--he rises up.
6.5.4 'May happiness rise to me; may glory rise to me'--when he has risen.
6.5.5 'Hereby I shake off the hater, the rival, the evil one, and the bringer of misfortune'--with (this formula) having shaken the end of the garment,--
6.5.6 The hymn, 'Away those to the east' (Rig-veda X, 131), the two (verses), 'And may Indra have mercy upon us' (II, 41, 11. 12), the one (verse), 'Of what we are in fear, O Indra' (VIII, 50, 13)--(when these texts have been murmured), they look with (the verse), 'A ruler indeed, great art thou' (X, 152, 1) to the east; with (the verse), 'The giver of bliss' (X, 152, 2) to the south, turned to the right; with (the verse), 'Away the Rakshas' (X, 152, 3) to the west; with (the verse), 'Destroy, O Indra, our' (X, 152, 4) to the north, turned to the left; with (the verse), 'Away, O Indra' (X, 152, 5) to the sky, turned to the right.
6.6.1 Having worshipped the Sun with (the verses), 'Savitri from the west,' 'This eye' (Rig-veda X, 36, 14; VII, 66, 16),
6.6.2 [*2]. They turn away, come back, sit down.
6.6.3 With (the words), 'As the water is appeased'--they draw water out of the vessel used for the expiation,
6.6.4 Pour it out on the ground,
6.6.5 [*5]. Spread (some) of that (water over the ground) with (the words), 'As the earth (is appeased),'--
6.6.6 [*6]. He (then) smears it on his right shoulder with (the words), 'Thus may peace dwell in me.'
6.6.7 In the same way a second time.
6.6.8 In the same way a third time.
6.6.9 'Piece by piece thou art produced; piece by piece thou risest up; bring welfare to us, O house!'--with (this text they) take pieces of Durva stalks (out of the vessel of water), put them on their heads,
6.6.10 [*10]. (And make water-offerings with the formulas), 'May Agni satiate himself; may Vayu satiate himself; may Surya satiate himself; may Vishnu satiate himself; may Pragapati satiate himself; may Virupaksha satiate himself; may Sahasraksha satiate himself; may all beings satiate themselves.'
6.6.11 [*11]. (Then) Sumantu, Gaimini, Vaisampayana, Paila, and the other teachers (receive their offerings).
6.6.12 [*12]. (Then) every one (worships in the same way) his fathers.
6.6.13 With (the text), 'To the sea you' (Sraut. IV, 11, 11) they pour out the water,
6.6.14 Murmur the Vamadevya,
6.6.15 And separate according to their pleasure.
6.6.16 (The final benedictory formula runs thus), 'Through the power of wisdom, of Sruti and Smriti, as handed down by tradition, through (that power) which has its measure in (the Vedic texts) that have been gone through(?), and which is possessed of undisputed firmness, may peace be with us in welfare. Adoration be to gods, Rishis, Manes, and men! May they whom we have adored, make happy life, beauty, health, peace, incolumity, imperishableness, vigour, splendour, glory, power, holy lustre, renown, age, offspring, cattle, adoration, increase. From wrongly spoken, wrongly used (prayer), from everything that is deficient or excessive, for the good of gods and Rishis, may the Brahman and Truth protect me; may the Brahman and Truth protect me!'

1.1 [*1] Now (follow) the ceremonies (the knowledge of) which is derived from practice (and not from the Sruti).
1.2 They should be performed during the northern course of the sun, on days of the first fortnight (of the month), on auspicious days,
1.3 With the sacrificial cord suspended over (the sacrificer's) left shoulder.
1.4 (The rites should be performed) from left to right.
1.5 The beginning should be made on the east side or on the north side,
1.6 And also the end.
1.7 [*7] Ceremonies belonging to the Fathers (are performed) in the second fortnight (of the month),
1.8 With the sacrificial cord suspended over the right shoulder,
1.9 From right to left,
1.10 Ending in the south.
1.11 Ceremonies occasioned by special occurrences (are performed) according as their occasions demand.
1.12 [*12] Having set the fire in a blaze, he strews eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it,
1.13 Or eastward-pointed and northward-pointed (grass);
1.14 Southward-pointed at sacrifices to the Fathers,
1.15 Or southward-pointed and eastward-pointed.
1.16 To the north of the fire he strews Darbha grass and (on that) he places the vessels (required for sacrifice) upside-down, two by two, if referring to ceremonies directed to the gods,
1.17 All at once, if to men,
1.18 One by one, if to the Fathers.
1.19 [*19] The preparation of the (blades used as) 'purifiers,' the measure of their length, the preparation of the Prokshani water, and the sprinkling of the vessels are the same here as at the sacrifices of the new and full moon, (but are performed) in silence.
1.20 [*20] To the west of the fire he pours water into a vessel over which he has laid (two grass blades called) purifiers, purifies (the water) three times with two northward-pointed purifiers, holds it on a level with his nose and mouth, places it to the north of the fire on Darbha grass, and covers it with Darbha grass.
1.21 [*21] On the south side he causes a Brahmana to sit down on Darbha grass.
1.22 He melts the Agya, pours it, to the west of the fire, into the Agya-pot, over which he has laid two purifiers, draws coals (out of the sacrificial fire) towards the mirth, puts (the Agya) on them, throws light on it by means of a burning (grass-blade), throws two Darbha points into it, moves a firebrand round it three times, takes it from the fire towards the north, sweeps the coals back (into the fire), purifies (the Agya) three times with two northward-pointed purifiers, moving them backward and forward, and throws the purifiers into the fire.
2.1 He warms at the fire the implement with which he sacrifices, wipes it off with Darbha blades, warms it again, sprinkles it (with water), puts it down, touches the Darbha blades with water, and throws them into the fire.
2.2 [*2] As paridhis (or pieces of wood laid round the fire) yoke-pins are used at the marriage, the Upanayana, the Samavartana, the parting of the (wife's) hair, the tonsure of the child's hair, the cutting of the beard, and at expiatory ceremonies.
2.3 He sprinkles water round the fire, on the south side from west to east with (the words), 'Aditi, give thy consent!' on the west side from south to north with 'Anumati, give thy consent!' on the north side from west to east with 'Sarasvati [sic], give thy consent!' all around with 'God Savitri, give thy impulse!'
2.4 At ceremonies belonging to the Fathers (water is sprinkled) only all round (the fire), silently.
2.5 [*5] Having put a piece of wood on the fire, he offers the two Aghara oblations as at the sacrifices of the new and full moon, silently.
2.6 [*6] Then he offers the two Agyabhaga oblations, over the easterly part of the northerly part (of the fire) with (the words), 'To Agni Svaha!' over the easterly part of the southerly part (another oblation) exactly like the preceding one, with (the words), 'To Soma Svaha!'
2.7 [*7] Having offered the chief oblations (belonging to each sacrifice) according to prescription, he adds the following oblations, viz. the Gaya, Abhyatana, Rashtrabhrit oblations, the oblation to Pragapati, the Vyahritis one by one, the oblation to (Agni) Svishtakrit with (the following formula), 'What I have done too much in this ceremony, or what I have done here too little, all that may Agni Svishtakrit, he who knows, make well sacrificed and well offered. Svaha!'
2.8 [*8] The sprinkling (of water) round (the fire is repeated) as above; the Mantras are altered so as to say, 'Thou hast given thy consent,' 'Thou hast given thy impulse.'
2.9 The designation 'Pakayagna' is used of ceremonies connected with worldly life.
2.10 [*10] There the ritual based on the Brahmana (holds good),
2.11 [*11] (To which the words allude), 'He sacrifices twice; he wipes off (his hand) twice; he partakes twice (of the sacrificial food); having gone away he sips (out of the Sruk) and licks off (the Sruk).'
2.12 All seasons are fit for marriage with the exception of the two months of the sisira season, and of the last summer month.
2.13 All Nakshatras which are stated to be pure, (are fit for marriage);
2.14 And all auspicious performances.
2.15 And one should learn from women what ceremonies (are required by custom).
2.16 [*16] Under the Invakas (Nakshatra), (the wooers who go to the girl's father) are sent out: such wooers are welcome.
3.1 [*1] Under the Maghas (Nakshatra) cows are provided;
3.2 Under the Phalguni (Nakshatra) marriage is celebrated.
3.3 [*3] A daughter whom he wishes to be dear (to her husband), a father should give in marriage under the Nishtya (Nakshatra); thus she becomes dear (to her husband); she does not return (to her father's) house: this is an observance based on a Brahmana.
3.4 [*4] The word Invakas means Mrigasiras; the word Nishtya means Svati.
3.5 [*5] At the wedding one cow;
3.6 In the house one cow:
3.7 With the (first cow) he should prepare an Argha reception for the bridegroom as for a guest,
3.8 With the other (the bridegroom [?] should do so) for a person whom he reveres.
3.9 These are the occasions for killing a cow: (the arrival of) a guest, (the Ashtaka sacrifice offered to) the Fathers, and marriage.
3.10 [*10] Let (the wooer) avoid in his wooing a girl that sleeps, or cries, or has left home.
3.11 [*11] And let him avoid one who has been given (to another), and who is guarded (by her relations), and one who looks wicked (?), or who is a most excellent one (?), or (who is like the fabulous deer) sarabha (?), a hunch-back, a girl of monstrous appearance, a bald-headed girl, a girl whose skin is like a frog's (?), a girl who has gone over to another family (?), a girl given to sensual pleasures (?), or a herdess, or one who has too many friends, or who has a fine younger sister, or one whose age is too near to that of the bridegroom (?).
3.12 [*12] Girls who have the name of a Nakshatra, or of a river, or of a tree, are objectionable.
3.13 And all girls in whose names the last letter but one is r or l, one should avoid in wooing.
3.14 If possible, he should place (the following) objects hidden before the girl, and should say to her, 'Touch (one of these things).'
3.15 (The objects are), different kinds of seeds mixed together, loose earth from (the kind of sacrificial altar called) vedi, an earth-clod from a field, cow-dung, and an earth-clod from a cemetery.
3.16 [*16] If she touches one of the former (objects, this portends) prosperity as characterized (by the nature of what she has touched).
3.17 The last is regarded as objectionable.
3.18 Let him marry a girl of good family and character, with auspicious characteristics, and of good health.
3.19 Good family, a good character, auspicious characteristics, learning, and good health: these are the accomplishments of a bridegroom.
3.20 A wife who is pleasing to his mind and his eyes, will bring happiness to him; let him pay no attention to the other things: such is the opinion of some.
4.1 Let him send out as his wooers friends who have assembled, who are versed in the Mantras.
4.2 He should recite over them the first two verses (Mantrap. I, 1, 1. 2).
4.3 When he himself has seen (the bride), let him murmur the third (verse; M. I, 1, 3).
4.4 With the fourth (M. I, 1, 4) let him behold her.
4.5 Let him seize with his thumb and fourth finger a Darbha blade, and let him wipe (therewith) the interstice between her eye-brows with the next Yagus (M. I, 1, 5), and let him throw it away towards the west.
4.6 If an omen occurs (such as the bride's or her relations' weeping), let him murmur the next (verse; M. I, 1, 6).
4.7 With the next (verse; M. I, 1, 7) let him send an even number of persons who have assembled there, and who are versed in the Mantras, to fetch water.
4.8 [*8] With the next Yagus (M. I, 1, 8) he places a round piece of Darbha net-work on her head; on that, with the next (verse; M. I, 1, 9) he places a right yoke-hole; on this hole he lays with the next (verse; M. I, 1, 10), a piece of gold, and washes her with the next five verses (M. I, 2, 1-5), (so that the water runs over that gold and through the yoke-hole); with the next (verse; M. I, 2, 6) he causes her to dress in a fresh garment, and with the next (M. I, 2, 7) he girds her with a rope.
4.9 Then he takes hold of her with the next (verse; M. I, 2, 8) by her right hand, leads her to the fire, spreads a mat, west of the fire, so that the points of the blades in it are directed towards the north, and on this mat they both sit down, the bridegroom to the north.
4.10 After the ceremonies have been performed from the putting of wood on the fire down to the Agyabhaga oblations, he recites over her the first two (verses of the third Anuvaka).
4.11 Then he should take with his right hand, palm down, her right hand which she holds palm up.
4.12 If he wishes that only daughters may be born to him, he should seize only the fingers (without the thumb);
4.13 If he wishes that only sons may be born to him, the thumb.
4.14 He takes (her hand) so as just to touch her thumb and the little hairs (on her hand),
4.15 With the four verses, 'I take thy hand' (Mantrap. I, 3, 3-6).
4.16 He then makes her step forward with her right foot, to the north of the fire, in an easterly or northerly direction, with (the formula), 'One step for sap' (M. I, 3, 7).
4.17 At her seventh step he murmurs, 'Be a friend' (M. I, 3, 14).
5.1 Having before the sacrifice gone round the fire, so that their right sides are turned towards it,
5.2 [*2] They sit down in their former position, and while she takes hold of him, he offers the oblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras), with (the Mantras), 'To Soma, the acquirer of a wife, Svaha!' (M. I, 4, I-16), one oblation with each Mantra.
5.3 [*3] He then causes her, to the north of the fire, to tread with her right foot on a stone, with (the verse), 'Tread' (M. I, 5, 1).
5.4 Having 'spread under' Agya into her joined hands, he pours roasted grain twice (into them), and sprinkles Agya over it.
5.5 Some say that an uterine relation of hers pours the grain (into her hands).
5.6 [*6] He (?) sacrifices (that grain) with (the verse), 'This wife' (M. I, 5, 2).
5.7 [*7] Having gone round the fire, with the right side turned towards it, with the next three (verses; M. I, 5, 3-5) he makes her tread on the stone as above (M. I, 5, 6).
5.8 And the oblation (is performed) with the next (verse; M. I, 5, 7).
5.9 (Then follow) again the circumambulation (M. I, 5, 8-10), the injunction to tread on the stone (I, 5, 11), and the oblation with the next (verse; I, 5, 12);
5.10 (Then) the circumambulation again (I, 5, 13-15).
5.11 [*11] He enters upon the performance of the Gaya and following oblations.
5.12 [*12] Having performed (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire), and having untied the rope with the next two verses (I, 5, 16. 17), he should then make her depart (from her father's house in a vehicle), or should have her taken away.
5.13 Having put that fire (with which the marriage rites have been performed, into a vessel), they carry it behind (the newly-married couple).
5.14 It should be kept constantly.
5.15 If it goes out, (a new fire) should be kindled by attrition,
5.16 Or it should be fetched from the house of a Srotriya.
5.17 Besides, if (the fire) goes out, one of them, either the wife or the husband, should fast.
5.18 Or he may sacrifice with the next (verse; M. I, 5, 18), and not fast.
5.19 The next (verse; M. I, 6, 1) is for putting the chariot (on which the young couple is to depart), in position;

5.25 And when they pass by bathing-places, posts, or cross-roads, let him murmur the next (verse; M. I, 6, 12).
6.1 The next (verse; M. I, 6, 13), he recites over a boat (with which they are going to cross a river).
6.2 And let the wife, when she is crossing, not see the crew.
6.3 When they have crossed, let him murmur the next (verse; M. I, 6, 14).
6.4 If they have to pass over a cemetery, or if any article (which they carry with them), or their chariot is damaged, the ceremonies from the putting of wood on the fire down to the Agyabhaga oblations are performed, and while she takes hold of him, he offers the oblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras; M. I, 7, 1-7), then he enters upon the performance of the Gaya and following oblations, and performs (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire).
6.5 If they pass by trees with milky sap or by other trees that serve as marks, by rivers or by deserts, he should murmur the next two (verses; M. I, 7, 8. 9), according to the characteristics in them (which refer to these different cases).
6.6 With the next (verse) he shows her the house(M. I, 7, 10).

6.8 Having, with the next (verse; M. I, 8, 1), spread out, in the centre of the house, a red bull's skin with the neck to the east, with the hair up, he causes her to recite the next (verse; M. I, 8, 2), while he makes her enter the house, (which she does) with her right foot.
6.9 And she does not stand on the threshold.
6.10 In the north-east part of the house the ceremonies from the putting of wood on the fire down to the Agyabhaga oblations are performed, and while she takes hold of him, he offers the oblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras; M. I, 8, 3-15); then he enters upon the performance of the Gaya and following oblations, and performs (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire). Then they sit down with the next (verse; M. I, 9, 1) on the skin, the bridegroom to the north.
6.11 He then places with the next (verse; M. I, 9, 2), the son of a wife who has only sons and whose children are alive, in her lap, gives fruits to the (child) with the next Yagus (M. I, 9, 3), and murmurs the next two (verses; M. I, 9, 4-5). Then he (and his wife) observe silence until the stars appear.
6.12 When the stars have appeared, he goes out (of the house with her) in an easterly or northerly direction, and shows her the polar star and (the star) Arundhati with the next two verses (M. I, 9, 6-7), according to the characteristics (contained in those verses).
7.1 [*1] He then makes her offer the sacrifice of a Sthalipaka sacred to Agni.
7.2 The wife husks (the rice grains out of which this Sthalipaka is prepared).
7.3 After he has cooked (the Sthalipaka), and has sprinkled (Agya) over it, and has taken it from the fire towards the east or the north, and has sprinkled (Agya) over it while it stands (there near the fire), (the ceremonies) from the putting of wood on the fire down to the Agyabhaga oblations (are performed), and while she takes hold of him, he sacrifices of that Sthalipaka.
7.4 The 'spreading under' and the sprinkling over (of Agya are done) once; two Avadanas (or cut-off portions are taken).
7.5 Agni is the deity (of the first oblation); the offering is made with the word Svaha.
7.6 [*6] Or he may sacrifice after having picked out, once, a portion (of the sacrificial food with the Darvi spoon).
7.7 Agni Svishtakrit is the second (deity).
7.8 (At the Svishtakrit oblation) the 'spreading under' and taking an Avadana are done once, the sprinkling over (of Agya) twice.
7.9 The Avadana for the first deity (is taken) out of the middle (of the Sthalipaka);
7.10 It is offered over the centre (of the fire).
7.11 (The Avadana) for the second (deity is taken) from the northern part (of the Sthalipaka);
7.12 It is offered over the easterly part of the northerly part (of the fire).
7.13 [*13] Having silently anointed (a part of) the Barhis (by dipping it) into the remains both (of the Sthalipaka and the Agya) in the way prescribed (in the Srauta ritual) for the (part of the Barhis called) Prastara, he throws (that part of the Barhis) into the fire.
7.14 [*14] (The rule regarding) the second sprinkling (of water round the fire) is valid (here).
7.15 He gives (the remains of) that (sacrificial food) with butter to a Brahmana to eat--
7.16 [*16] Whom he reveres. To that (Brahmana) he makes the present of a bull.
7.17 In the same way, with the exception of the sacrificial gift, they should sacrifice a Sthalipaka from then onwards, on the days of the new and full moon, after having fasted.
7.18 Some say that a vessel full (of grain) is the sacrificial gift.
7.19 [*19] From then onwards he should offer morning and evening with his hand these two oblations (to Agni and to Agni Svishtakrit) of (rice) grains or of barley.
7.20 The deities are the same as at the Sthalipaka (just described).
7.21 Some say that the first oblation in the morning is sacred to Surya.
7.22 [*22] Before and after (those oblations) the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire is performed) as stated above.
7.23 [*23] By the sacrifice of the new and full moon the other ceremonies have been explained (the knowledge of) which is derived from practice.

7.25 [*25] The sacrifice (of a cow) on the arrival of a guest (should be performed as stated below) without alterations.
7.26 [*26] (The deities) of the Vaisvadeva ceremony are the Visve devas,
7.27 [*27] Of ceremonies performed on full-moon days, the full-moon day on which they are performed.
8.1 [*1] At the opening and concluding ceremonies of the Vedic study, the Rishi who is indicated (as the Rishi of the Kanda which they study, is the deity to whom the ceremony belongs),
8.2 And in the second place Sadasaspati (cf. Mantrap. I, 9, 8).
8.3 They reject a sacrifice performed by a wife or by one who has not received the Upanayana initiation, and a sacrifice of salt or pungent food, or of such food as has an admixture of a despised sort of food.
8.4 Sacrifices connected with special wishes and Bali sacrifices (should be performed) as stated (even against the clauses of the last Sutra).
8.5 Whenever the fire flames up of itself, he should put two pieces of wood on it with the next two (verses: M. I, 9, 9-10),
8.6 Or with (the two formulas), 'May fortune reach me! May fortune come to me!'

8.8 (From that day) through three nights they should both sleep on the ground, they should be chaste, and should avoid salt and pungent food.
8.9 Between their sleeping-places a staff is interposed, which is anointed with perfumes and wrapped round with a garment or a thread.
8.10 In the last part of the fourth night he takes up the (staff) with the next two (verses; M. I, 10, 1-2), washes it and put it away; then (the ceremonies) from the putting of wood on the fire down to the Agyabhaga oblations (are performed), and while she takes hold of him, he sacrifices the oblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras; M. I, 10, 3-9); then he enters upon the performance of the Gaya and following oblations, and performs (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire). Then he makes her sit down to the west of the fire, facing the east, and pours some Agya of the remains (of those oblations) on her head with the (three) Vyahritis and the word Om as the fourth (M. I, 10, 10-13). Then they look at each other with the next two verses (M. I, 11, 1-2), according to the characteristics (contained in those verses); with the next verse (M. I, 11, 3) he besmears the region of their hearts with remains of Agya; then he should murmur the next three verses (I, 11, 4-6), and should murmur the rest (of the Anuvaka; I, 11, 7-11) when cohabiting with her.

9.2 If he sneezes or coughs while going about on business, he should touch water and should murmur the two following (verses; M. I, 13, 5. 6) according to the characteristics (which they contain).
9.3 In the same way with the next (Mantras--M. I, 13, 7-10--he should address the following objects), according to the characteristics (which those Mantras contain): a conspicuous tree, a heap of excrements, the skirt (of his garment) which is blown against him by the wind, and a shrieking bird.
9.4 One (for instance, the wife's father) who wishes that the hearts of both (husband and wife) may be in accord should observe chastity through at least three nights and should prepare a Sthalipaka. Then (the ceremonies) from the putting (of wood) on (the fire) down to the Agyabhaga oblations (are performed), and while the wife takes hold of him, he sacrifices of the Sthalipaka the oblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras; M. I, 14, 1-7); then he enters upon the performance of the Gaya and following oblations, and performs (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire). (The remains of) the (sacrificial food) with butter, he should give to eat to an even number of Brahmanas, at least to two, and should cause them to pronounce wishes for his success.
9.5 [*5] When the moon, on the following day, will be in conjunction with Tishya, she strews three times seven barley-grains around (the plant) Clypea Hernandifolia with (the formula), 'If thou belongest to Varuna, I redeem thee from Varuna. If thou belongest to Soma, I redeem thee from Soma.'
9.6 On the following day she should set upright (the plant) with the next (verse; M. I, 15, 1), should recite the next three (verses; M.

I, 15, 6).
9.7 Thus he will be subject to her.
9.8 By this (rite) also (a wife) overcomes her co-wives.
9.9 For this same purpose she worships the sun daily with the next Anuvaka (M. I, 16).
9.10 If a wife is affected with consumption or is otherwise sick, one who has to observe chastity, should rub her limbs with young lotus leaves which are still rolled up, and with lotus roots, with the next (formulas, limb by limb) according to the characteristics (contained in those formulas; M. I, 17, 1-6), and should throw away (the leaves and roots) towards the west.

10.2 Let him initiate a Brahmana in the eighth year after the conception,
10.3 A Raganya in the eleventh, a Vaisya in the twelfth year after the conception.
10.4 Spring, summer, autumn: these are the (fit) seasons (for the Upanayana), corresponding to the order of the castes.
10.5 (The boy's father) serves food to Brahmanas and causes them to pronounce auspicious wishes, and serves food to the boy. (The teacher?) pours together, with the first Yagus (of the next Anuvaka, warm and cold) water, pouring the warm water into the cold, and moistens (the boy's) head with the next (verse; M. II, 1, 2).

10.9 [*9] After (the boy) has bathed, and (the ceremonies) from the putting (of wood) on (the fire) down to the Agyabhaga oblations (have been performed), he causes him to put a piece of Palasa wood on the fire with the next (verse; M. II, 2, 1), and makes him tread with his right foot on a stone to the north of the fire, with (the verse), 'Tread' (M. II, 2, 2).
